5,"A great look at what's new on the kosher scene - recipes, cookbook reviews, lifestyle and more!","""Joy of Kosher"" magazine fills a much-needed niche for kosher recipes, cookbook reviews, and the kosher lifestyle not found in other mainstream magazines. Sporting beautifully-photographed covers and spreads that are equally at home next to powerhouse food and cooking magazines, ""Joy of Kosher"" (which merged with Bitayavon in 2012) is your source for all things kosher. Far beyond mere recipes, ""Joy of Kosher"" includes news on kosher restaurants, kosher wines, cookbooks, kitchen tools, holiday decorating tips, and articles on kosher travel. You'll read interviews with kosher chefs and entrepreneurs and spotlights on new kosher products. Kosher wines and wine pairings are given plenty of space; there are dozens of up-and-coming kosher wineries in Israel (over 70!) and many top-rated wines among them.<br /><br />More than just a cooking magazine (which it does very well), ""Joy of Kosher"" is a lifestyle magazine; sure, the emphasis is on kosher food and wine, but you'll also find articles on food and health, family outings/activities (such as the ""Apple Picking: the Ultimate Family Trip"" story from Fall 2013), and traditions. You'll also find articles that explore Jewish beliefs and their relationship to food. And the kosher recipes represent the culinary wealth of the Jewish Diaspora and beyond; you'll find  Italian caponata and herbed spaetzle rubbing elbows with whitefish shu mai dumplings, beef larb, or Moroccan-inspired tagines, along with upscale kosher dishes that mirror current trends. You'll see many articles and recipes from famous chefs in the kosher food world, including Jamie Geller (the ""Jewish Rachael Ray"" and author of two kosher cookbooks, including [[ASIN:0062207822 Joy of Kosher: Fast, Fresh Family Recipes]]), kosher pastry chef Paula Shoyer (author of [[ASIN:1454907142 The Holiday Kosher Baker: Traditional & Contemporary Holiday Desserts]]), and Chef Laura Frankel (author of my favorite ""[[ASIN:0470260890 Jewish Slow Cooker Recipes]]"").<br /><br />Most importantly, the recipes are completely approachable using ingredients that should be readily available at your supermarket. Each issue also includes a handy recipe and nutrition guide that features an alphabetical listing of all recipes along with calories, fiber, sodium, carbs, fat and protein; as I watch my fat and calorie intake, I appreciated having this information readily available as not many cooking magazines provide it on a consistent basis (if at all). Recent issues have also put a spotlight on gluten-free and other special diets and a special focus on seasonal foods.<br /><br />One thing you'll quickly notice is that advertising takes up a fair chunk of the magazine; in the Winter 2013 issue, I counted about 25 pages of full and half-page ads (some for other Joy of Kosher products) out of about 83 total. The colorful advertising in many cases blends in fairly seamlessly with the rest of the content.<br /><br />The Joy of Kosher website offers additional articles, recipes, (kosher) cookbook reviews and giveaways that have introduced me to some great new kosher cookbooks (and I was also lucky enough to win an [[ASIN:B0015FLBCA Emile Henry Flame Top 3.7 Quart Tagine, Red]] as part of their ""Best of Kosher 2013"" contest!). Whether you're looking for new ideas for quick and easy (or international-themed) kosher meals, decorating ideas, or kosher vacation rentals and getaways, you're sure to love ""Joy of Kosher""!",[],B00HCR5090,B00HCR5090,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,2014-04-06 23:32:53.000,4,False
5,"If you enjoy reading an eye-catching, easy-to-follow cooking magazine with fresh updates on old favorites, this is for you.","I've been addicted to Martha Stewart's Everyday Food for several years, but until recently, I had been buying it by the issue instead of shelling out $30 for a year's subscription.<br /><br />I love the fact that Everyday Food takes everyday ingredients and makes them extraordinary. Example: in a recent issue, 10 different chicken recipes were given, along with a primer on chicken and a wine pairing guide. The included chicken recipes ranged from classics such as chicken tenders, BBQ chicken and chicken club salad to the more exotic Greek chicken cutlets (with feta, olives, tomato and mint) and Indian-spiced braised chicken (ginger, coriander, yogurt, garam masala).<br /><br />Another issue had a divine no-hassle dessert that tasted like a labor-intensive tiramisu: whipped ricotta, sugar, and instant espresso topped with crumbled cookies. Bonus: no raw eggs.<br /><br />Everyday Food also has an eye out for healthier foods, including a focus on whole grains. Another recent issue featured a delicious bulgur breakfast porridge and veggie burgers with tahini mayonnaise. In the back of each issue is an Everyday Pantry checklist perfect for ripping out and taking along to the store. There is also a nutritional guide provided (I liked it better when it was at the rear of each magazine rather than in the front next to the table of contents).<br /><br />In addition, Everyday Food frequently features articles on kitchen tools and appliances that are helpful for novice and experienced cooks alike.<br /><br />My main criticism is that for a slim magazine, roughly 40% consists of distracting print ads. Also, Everyday Food is on the expensive side at $35 for 10 issues. And I liked it better having the nutritional info listed at the back, rather than the front. But these are minor gripes.<br /><br />Compact and colorful, Everyday Food is a wonderful tool for any chef, particularly if you're short on time and you're looking for new ways to spice up your weeknight menus.",[],B0000ARXXS,B0000ARXXS,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,2007-06-15 04:04:15.000,4,False

5,Short Historical Articles on All Kinds of Handwork--With Projects Using Historical Techniques,"For many years, I have subscribed to PIECEWORK magazine, because I love reading articles about the history of beautiful handmade items (whether they're made by needlepoint, quilting, embroidery, knitting, crochet, bobbin lace, sewing, applique, beading, tatting, or some other technique).  From time to time I've thought about letting my subscription lapse (to save a little money and some storage space), but then I remember that PIECEWORK is the one magazine that I always look at and read, as soon as each new issue arrives.<br /><br />When PIECEWORK was first launched, it had more emphasis on historical textiles (many of museum quality) than it does at present.  Today, because the magazine has already published so many articles on historical textiles, the emphasis is more on using historical textiles as inspiration for modern projects.  But each issue still includes complete instructions for a few small projects that use the historical/ethnic designs or techniques described in the articles (e.g., a crocheted lace edging, an embroidered sampler, a knitted Peruvian hat, a small pieced quilt).<br /><br />In recent years, PIECEWORK has published annual ""lace"" and ""historical knitting"" issues, which have multiple articles dealing with those special topics.  I love the special issues, but I also enjoy the regular issues that include a variety of short articles on several different kinds of handwork--ranging from sewn aprons through beaded bags, the Bayeux Tapestry, embroidered pincushions, a silk wedding dress made from a WWII parachute, Coptic socks, nursery rhyme buttons, decorative braided landscapes, linens embellished with hardanger embroidery, or some other kind of handmade item, depending on the issue.  The short articles are illustrated with historical photos, and often accompanied by references for further reading.  In truth, I have never received a single issue of PIECEWORK that didn't contain at least one article that was well worth the price of the magazine.",[],B00006KSSX,B00006KSSX,AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q,2013-03-08 01:57:42.000,8,False

2,"Some Decent Content, but drowned out in Advertisements","We were looking for a magazine for our 4 year old that would allow him to discover new things and let us expose him to the amazing things around him.  National Geographic for Kids sounded perfect.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the magazine turned out to be filled with advertisements and non-educational articles.  At least once per issue, a story is dedicated to an children's movie.  Also, there are lots of ads for video games, many of which contain violent content (just a warning if you are trying to keep your kids away from violent video games).<br /><br />In the end, the magazine seemed more like Saturday morning TV rather than a PBS nature show, which is what we were expecting.  The potential is there, but in all honesty, I think we get more out of flipping through a National Geographic with our son, then we do flipping through a National Geographick Kids.<br /><br />Ranger Rick, Big Backyard are better choices, although they are wildlife/nature specific.

5,SO Happy To Receive TV Guide Again!,"I love TV Guide and have always been a huge fan.  I was a subscriber years ago but wound up canceling due to the TV show schedule the cable company provides right on the TV. Seemed like a waste of money to subscribe to TV Guide when I could just take a look at the schedule chart right on the TV for free.  But I missed TV Guide and when I spotted a one year subscription  for both print and Kindle for only $20, I couldn't resist and subscribed once again.  I've now received my first issue and I'm thrilled. I really have missed this magazine. Yes, I can see the same TV show schedule right on the TV but I like having the paper magazine by my side to check out the schedule and I especially LOVE to read the articles and look over the TV show rating results.  And, of course, the crossword puzzle! SO happy to have my weekly crossword puzzle back! I do love my Kindle and use it all the time.

4,New Mexico Travel and Culture,"I like magazines that emphasize travel and culture. I like them even more when they focus not just on the popular tourist spots, but also on lesser- known travel gems that can be found in every state in the nation. A magazine that fulfills my wishes is New Mexico Magazine.<br /><br />With this monthly publication, you get a rundown of the events, the places, the people, the art, and the food that make New Mexico unique. The photography is eye- catching and there is a good mixture of articles relating to natural attractions vs man- made points of interest and events, as well as a good number of articles dedicated to well-known and not well- known attractions.<br /><br />The layout of this publication is good and I like the state map in the front that shows the locations of the featured destinations in each issue. There are monthly sections for art and food, the latter of which includes recipes so that you can create authentic New Mexican food right at home. For a touch of humor, turn near the end of the issue and enjoy the monthly feature called One of Our 50 is Missing. It has short, funny stories of New Mexicans who discover that much of the rest of United States is apparently unaware that New Mexico is a U.S. state.<br /><br />It's fun to learn about places to go and people to meet. New Mexico has much to offer in terms of natural scenery, great food and culture, and friendly folks. New Mexico Magazine brings it all together for you, in each monthly issue. A few less ads would be cool, but this is still a very good publication for learning more about New Mexico and for planning your next visit.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51QwRWJtw-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51QwRWJtw-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51QwRWJtw-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618XVU-etGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618XVU-etGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618XVU-etGL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00006KPSH,B00006KPSH,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2022-03-25 18:23:30.565,0,False
4,Get Your Dose of Political Discussion with The Nation,"Politics can make for some entertaining and lively conversation. In recent years in particular, political talk has been livelier than ever, but it has also turned ugly and the once civil discourse between dissenting views has become more opinionated and even personal. One magazine that fits in very well with these times of political polarization is The Nation<br /><br />The Nation is a magazine that is all about political issues from a decidedly left- leaning perspective. No matter what the issue, The Nation takes a progressive position that seeks to bring about change in order to benefit the largest number of people - at least, in the minds of its writers. Whether the topic is gun control, taxing the wealthy, improving health care, or expanding government benefits, The Nation’s position is frank and always takes a leftward slant.<br /><br />I read a few different political magazines and have found some of them good, even if I don’t necessarily agree with every position they take.  With The Nation, the formula is similar to that of other political magazines but one difference I have noticed is that The Nation seems a little more extreme and angrier than the others of its ilk. The articles sometimes voice a sense of irritation, like the writers just cannot believe what is going on around them and why Americans have not wised up and smelled the dead rat in front of them. Yes, there are some articles like this in the other political publications, but the Nation really lets its irritation shine through.<br /><br />This is not to say that The Nation is completely without any good articles. It does hit the nail on the head with several of them, like ones promoting church/state separation, civil rights, and other topics. The writers do manage to make some very compelling, articulate points. The articles that voice irritation can sometimes twist reasoning and logic, but these social issue articles often make good sense and the writers seem to know the topics well. Yes, they are biased but that is precisely what a magazine like this is all about: Promoting a specific point of view from one side of the issue, completing ignoring most or all counter viewpoints.<br /><br />I like reading political magazines even if I don’t agree with everything they say. The Nation has some articles that are difficult to stomach, but it has others that offer some good insights into the important issues of the day from an alternative but always left- leaning perspective. Even if you are a dyed in the wool conservative, there are still some important things to learn from the opposition and The Nation provides everything you would ever want to know about education, the economy, foreign policy, civil rights and more from a distinctly leftward point of view.",[],B00XZF1JUM,B00XZF1JUM,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2019-06-27 01:57:56.336,3,False
4,America's National Parks Need Our Protection,"America has many great wonderlands and its system of National Parks, National Preserves, Seashores, Monuments, Memorials, etc., is the most developed in the world. The many great scenic and historical preservations are spotlighted in this publication, National Parks Magazine, the magazine of the National Parks Conservation Association.<br /><br />National Parks Magazine is published quarterly and can be counted on for about three featured articles and standard departments. The magazine aims to keep its supporters and others informed about the challenges, success stories, and various concerns surrounding the different units of the National Park service.<br /><br />This magazine is published by a non- profit organization that is focused on conservation and because of that fact, the issues tend to talk mainly about the many problems that plague the parks and what needs to be done to correct them. The NPCA likes to talk about its own efforts and successes in this magazine, but it is also quick to point out when more work needs to be done.  Other readings in each issue sometimes venture into informative or educational articles. The informative articles are the type one would expect in a publication such as this. They feature a specific National Park, National River, etc., and then take the reader on a journey throughout the park unit, filling the reader in on the important things to know if planning a visit. The educational articles are often about animals and present facts that make the animal unique and worth conserving.<br /><br />National Parks Magazine is a very nice, well- written and informative read and there are very few advertisements. America has some amazing National Parks, National Monuments, and other nationally designated sites and National Parks Magazine does a nice job bringing the different units into your life through its quarterly reporting. It would be cool if the magazine talked more about visiting the parks and what they offer, but you have to keep in mind that this magazine is tied to a non- profit organization that is focused on conservation and because of this, the writings ten to be geared in an activist direction. Remember this before you decide to subscribe and enjoy your issues of National Parks Magazine.",[],B00006KP86,B00006KP86,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2019-06-12 01:40:17.546,4,False
5,Learn About Our Past with American Archaeology,"Published by the Archaeological Conservancy, American Archaeology is a quarterly publication that summarizes many of the important happenings in the world of archaeology around the United States. The magazine talks about ancient cultures and ways of life as we interpret them today based on recent archaeological findings.<br /><br />I’m a supporter of the Archaeological Conservancy and one of the benefits of supporting this non- profit organization is that you get a subscription to this magazine with your membership. And it is certainly worth the money, as this is easily one of the best magazines of its kind or any kind. The articles help you get in touch with ancient peoples, understand their way of life, and discover what drove Native Americans and others to live the way they lived.<br /><br />This publication isn’t strictly about the United States. It does venture into other areas of the continent from time to time and it doesn’t always resort to ancient times for its inspiration. Some of the articles are based on happenings from the more recent past- sometimes, only a hundred or so years ago. It shows that any piece of history, ancient or not, can still be worthy of an archaeological discovery.<br /><br />American Archaeology is a well- edited magazine and one thing many readers will greatly appreciate is the lack of advertising. Other than a few small ads near the beginning and end of each issue, the rest of the magazine is advertisement free. And even the few ads that exist are not bad at all, for the simple fact that they feature relevant services, usually seminars and excursions focused on archaeology.<br /><br />Learning about the past and preserving historic sites, structures, burial mounds, etc. is an important way to discover more about who we are as people. American Archaeology is an excellent publication for those who want to tap into our heritage and learn more ways how we can preserve and interpret these important remnants of human history. It’s one of my favorite magazines and I recommend it to anyone with an interest in this subject.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/613ysz4j6EL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/613ysz4j6EL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/613ysz4j6EL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00006K32H,B00006K32H,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2018-10-08 02:57:45.998,3,False
5,Archaeology Magazine: One of the Best Magazines in Existence,"I have several magazines that I consult for my reading enjoyment and/or enlightenment. With most of them, I thumb through and focus only on articles that seem interesting, but there are a few magazines that seem to hit the mark so consistently that I read the almost the entire issue month after month. One good example of the latter is Archaeology Magazine.<br /><br />What sets this magazine apart from most others is the content itself. Yes, there are some cool illustrations but where Archaeology Magazine shines is with the articles themselves. They are packed full of fascinating information and they enrich your knowledge of history. And I don’t mean refresh your knowledge- I mean enrich, because much of what you read here is going to involve historical facts you likely never heard before. I come away from every issue learning something brand new about a specific era in world history and the cultures that lived and thrived during that time.<br /><br />Archaeology Magazine has very few advertisements. Most of them are clustered at the end of each issue, so you get uninterrupted reading from start to finish. Another thing I love is that most of the articles are not excessively long. Some are only a half- page or less. At most, they might cover four pages tops. I like this, because I’m the type who may not want to commit to a long, say, 10 page magazine article. I read some magazine with long articles like this and the moment I see that it’s going to be this long- and I always check before I start reading- I often skip the article completely.<br /><br />Yet another reason to love Archaeology Magazine is the quality of the writing. The editors make sure each article is clear and concise, with proper grammar and clarity. The articles are educational and they maintain an academic style. You’re not going to find much in the way of humor or other creative forms of non- fiction prose. No, Archaeology Magazine sticks with the facts and presents them in and informative way that archaeology and history enthusiasts will appreciate.<br /><br />I usually skim through most magazines, but Archaeology Magazine is different. It is one of the very few magazines that maintain my interest from beginning to end, with every article worthy of a read. Try this magazine for yourself, and get enlightened on the fascinating world we live in and all of its glorious past.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Jl7G5XcXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Jl7G5XcXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Jl7G5XcXL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Y8aFaIzSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Y8aFaIzSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Y8aFaIzSL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B000FTJ7BE,B000FTJ7BE,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2018-05-20 15:39:36.794,17,False
5,National Wildlife Magazine Informs and Educates,"National Wildlife Magazine is a very nice publication for those with an active interest in wildlife protection and general nature conservation. It offers some very good articles on wildlife and the constant struggles animals face as they fight for survival in a world increasingly dominated by humans.<br /><br />National Wildlife Magazine seeks to inform and educate and its articles include stories about success stories and challenges as well as the occasional article or department that offers up animal trivia and facts. One article may include a story about the loss of habitat for wild cats while another may talk about the brute size and strength of a rhinoceros. Whatever the story, this magazine is right there, informing and educating its readers about the wild and wonderful world of animals.<br /><br />Advertisements are part of this publication and this fact may surprise some who read this publication for the first time. Many non- profit organizations publish magazines but a good percentage of these magazines are completely ad- free. This magazine has a few ads, but they cover only about one- fifth of the pages in each issue. There are few enough of them that they do not take away from the magazine's enjoyment.<br /><br />Besides the articles, another excellent feature of National Wildlife Magazine is the photography. In fact, I would bet that some people try to get their hands on this magazine solely for the purpose of looking at those amazing photographs of animals in their natural habitat. The photographs are impressive and memorable, with some of them depicting an animal standing still or lying down in the wild and others showing an animal chasing and catching its prey, in high speed detail. Every issue is loaded with these amazing pictures of animals and it isn't surprising that so many readers mention the photographs among their favorite parts of the magazine.<br /><br />Wildlife continues to struggle for survival and National Wildlife Magazine is one of the better non- profit publications that bring this information to your home. It is not an easy magazine to find, but I recommend grabbing and reading a copy if you can. It rates among my all- time favorite wildlife magazines.",[],B00006KPBF,B00006KPBF,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2012-09-28 18:52:31.000,3,False
5,Garden Gate: Great Magazine Free From Advertising,"Garden Gate Magazine is a publication for gardeners of all stripes- a magazine with nice photography, gardening and craft instructions, and general tips to make your garden and general landscaping look better then ever. Amatuers and experienced gardeners alike will find many useful tips and bits of advice on decoration, plant care, and more.<br /><br />I'm not big on outdoor creations, but I agree that a well- manicured landscape and a nice garden area is not only easy on the eyes, it can also add a sense of peacefulness by its mere presence. Who doesn't enjoy walking into a beautiful garden area? Even if you have little interest in gardening, horticulture, or anything related, there is much to be said for a nice, green/flowery yard and Garden Gate Magazine is very useful to help you achieve exactly that, with projects and advice for individuals at different skill levels.<br /><br />I have been reading Garden Gate Magazine for only a short time but I have found much useful information in this publication. The lists and the step by step instructions are among my favorites and I like that the magazine is not geared only toward those with the extra- green thumbs. I am not very skilled in a garden so I need a publication that respects my limited abilities. Garden Gate Magazine has plenty to offer an inexperienced person like myself and at the same time, it has plenty of great ideas that involve more extensive building and planting, making the magazine useful for the more experienced individual. Garden Gate Magazine leaves no person behind, and that is one of the publication's many appeals.<br /><br />Garden Gate Magazine spells everything out nicely and includes plenty of diagrams so that even an outdoor klutz like myself can figure out what each thing means and what to do. The magazine has a good deal of information, too, and some might find it surprising that a publication with only 50 pages can include so much in so little space. Take a look at the Departments, ""In Every Issue"", and features listed above. When was the last time you saw a table of contents like that in a fifty-page magazine? There is a reason Garden Gate Magazine is able to pack in so much in so little room and the reason is there are no advertisements!! This is such a refreshing change from other magazines and it makes a big difference when you are trying to follow instructions. There is nothing to distract and the articles are not very long, making this the perfect reading option for those with shorter attention spans.<br /><br />When a magazine is free from advertisements, it is often high in price and Garden Gate Magazine is no exception. The magazine is published only six times per year and each issue carries a high cover price around five dollars. To make matters worse, you don't get much of a cut in price when you subscribe. Buy all six issues at your local newsstand and it will cost you $30. Subscribe for a year, and it will cost you $24. This is a savings, yes, but it isn't nearly the level of subscription savings so common with other magazines. A two- year deal makes the savings better (presently 2 years are offered for $38, cutting the cover price by 37 percent), but the cost per issue is still quite high and it is the direct result of publishing ad- free.<br /><br />If you can get past the cost, however, you will find that Garden Gate Magazine is a very good magazine with much to offer everyone who loves a nice landscape. As I said, I'm not even much into this type of work and I don't landscape as a hobby, yet I still like reading this magazine. If a publication can pique the interest of someone who doesn't even have a true interest in the subject, it must be doing something right and Garden Gate Magazine is definitely a periodical that is doing almost everything correctly.",[],B002MRSM8Q,B002MRSM8Q,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2012-07-20 19:50:50.000,25,False
2,"National Geographic Kids: Too Much Fluff, too Little Education","Kids like to read magazines and books as long as they contain visual elements, games, and other things to keep them entertained. They don't even mind a little bit of education and learning as long as it is entertaining in some way. This is why kids' magazines are often so visual and colorful and National Geographic kids is, as expected, a publication loaded with pictures and bright colors. The magazine is focused mainly on animals, but also includes material on science, geography, technology, etc.<br /><br />My girls are big fans of several kids' magazines and they look forward to receiving issues in the mail each month. I like most of them, due to their educational value. But I must take exception to National Geographic Kids magazine. This publication does contain some educational material, but the problem is that the education is minimal, with the remaining pages covered with meaningless fluff and advertisements. The ads are especially annoying because National Geographic Kids intermingles the ads into what seems like an educational article. It is done in a subtle way that you may not even notice at first.<br /><br />National Geographic Kids attempts to break up the educational material with trivia, some photographs, and a few other things, but they are not items I would expect to see in a publication that is supposed to be aimed at children in the later elementary school age years and that is supposed to educate. It is also surprising how thin the magazine is- it seems more like a thick newsletter than a magazine publication.<br /><br />National Geographic itself is a great magazine and I am very surprised that such a quality publication would permit its name to be scarred by the likes of this magazine. It could be so much better with a little work. It isn't like National Geographic doesn't have the resources to make improvements. They have the expertise and the know- how to make a quality kids magazine, but seem content with this publication in its present form, in spite of its many flaws.<br /><br />Kids magazines are plentiful and there are some really good publications available that help teach kids about different subjects in an entertaining way. National Geographic Kids, unfortunately, isn't one of them. The worthwhile material can be isolated to about one- third of the magazine's limited pages and the overall educational value is minimal. Sum everything together and you have a magazine that isn't worth the money and should be avoided.",[],B000063XJL,B000063XJL,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2012-05-06 14:48:55.000,8,False
4,Texas Monthly Keeps You Up to Speed with the Lone Star State,"Texas Monthly Magazine is a magazine about a state, its places, and its people. This publication covers Texas culture, travel, music, arts, dining, special events, and more. Each issue takes readers on a journey throughout the state and keeps them up to date on the Lone Star State and her people.<br /><br />Texas Monthly Magazine has more departments than the typical magazine and many of them are fun to read, offering a quick look inside a lesser- known town, festival, or individual that calls Texas home. A good example is the department titled Street Smarts. This short section offers a glimpse inside one of Texas' thousands of small towns along with a numbered list of special points of interest in the city. The music and books departments are fun, too, because they present some popular and soon- to- be- popular media from Texas residents. Another department I like for its pleasant amusement is one called the Manual. It presents something Texas- related in the areas of fashion and style and then offers some advice on the best usage or display of the item based on Texas culture.<br /><br />Texas Monthly Magazine offers several long, featured articles and they can usually be found starting in the middle of each issue and continuing all the way to about the three- quarter mark. These longer featured articles can focus on most anything, from travel to art to food, to the people who create the art and prepare the food.  There are usually at least a few current event- type articles related to something important in the news while the other featured articles include stories about people, events, etc., that are generally timeless.<br /><br />Texas Monthly Magazine is a well- written, well- edited magazine and it a nice reference and reading tool for Texas residents who like to learn more about the state and find new places to visit and things to try. I like having it handy, but if I could change one thing about this magazine, it would be the number of ads in each issue. True, all magazines need advertisements in order to generate reveune, but the number of ads in Texas Monthly Magazine is a tad excessive. Each issue opens up with about eighteen pages of ads before even reaching the table of contents. The next hundred or so pages have ads on every other page and the ads only diminish when you get to one of the featured articles. After that, the ads return for the remainder of the issue, with the final thirty to fifty pages consisting of practically nothing but ads.<br /><br />Going back to the positive points, another reason to like Texas Monthly is the long length of each issue. The magazine is much longer than most, with some issues approaching 300 pages in length. Yes, the ads are excessive, but even if all the ads were removed, you would still have a very large amount of reading material in each issue- much more than found in the majority of magazines.<br /><br />Texas is a very large, very diverse state with many things to offer and Texas Monthly is a very enjoyable read that helps Texas residents keep up with some of the many happenings in this great state. The ads are excessive, but when all factors are taken into account, this is still an enjoyable publication that every Texan should read and that many outsiders will enjoy as well.",[],B00005N7T3,B00005N7T3,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2011-12-24 03:59:21.000,1,False
3,"Women's Fitness, and Other Things","Fitness Magazine is a health/beauty/fitness publication that concentrates its efforts on the physical well- being of the individual. This magazine is geared toward woman's health and it offers some good articles on such health- inspired topics as the nutritional content of specific foods; strategies for losing weight; natural ways to battle allergies; and many more.<br /><br />Getting in shape and staying in shape are certainly worthwhile goals and this magazine has some good pointers, but there are a few things about this magazine that I do not appreciate. One is the misleading title. When I see the word ""fitness"" on the front of a magazine, I expect the publication to dedicate itself not just to losing weight, but also staying in shape through physical workouts, weightlifting, and more. However, there isn't much in this magazine that is dedicated to fitness education, weightlifting, or any other similar topic. The other issue I have with this magazine is its beauty and fashion emphasis. True, some of these articles do correlate with health and fitness but others are more fluff than substance.<br /><br />Looking at other aspects of Fitness Magazine, I like that it includes the featured cover articles in their own reference section because this makes it easy to open an issue and go directly to an article of interest. I also like the low price. You don't find magazines priced at such a low level nowadays, and this is a refreshing change. On the other hand, there are a large number of advertisements in each issue, and this is likely part of the reason the retail price is kept at such a low level.<br /><br />So, what is my bottom line on this magazine? Well, there is some good material in this publication, some good advice on medical matters and nutrition, and other positive qualities. However, this publication deviates from the subject of fitness on a frequent basis and it doesn't contain many articles on the mind and spirit, like its subtitle suggests. Thus, the pros and cons are just about on par with each other, leading to an average rating overall.",[],B0029XHGT4,B0029XHGT4,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2010-12-08 22:07:45.000,2,False
4,Popular Mechanics: Practical and often Fascinating,"Popular Mechanics is a magazine dedicated to mechanics, repair, industry, and technology. This magazine offers timely articles that are often intelligent, thought- provoking, and often fascinating and/or awe- inspiring. They often talk about mechanical achievements, impressive technology, record- setting feats, etc. These articles show what humans are capable of doing and they remain in your memory for some time.<br /><br />These achievement- type articles are often the best in each issue, however, Popular Mechanics is more than just a magazine about incredible achievements. With Popular Mechanics, you get articles about cars, home improvement, repair, etc., which are more practical than anything. Car enthusiasts often enjoy Popular Mechanics more than anyone, due to the magazine's consistent articles on automobiles and reviews of automobiles. There are, in fact, multiple articles on automobiles and/or automotive technology in each issue and they are often among the lengthiest in the magazine.<br /><br />Besides cars, Popular Mechanics likes to devote space to the subject of home repair and improvement. These articles are nice because they offer practical advice that can help do- it- yourself readers save a good deal of cash. They are often educational in nature, too. How Your House Works, for example, is a subsection of the Home department and it describes in detail how a certain part of your home functions. It might sound boring at first, but it is often fascinating to learn what goes on behind the walls, under the foundation, inside the appliances, etc. Sometimes, the educational lesson is obvious but other times, the lessons learned are eye- opening and will expose homeowners to things about their home they never knew existed.<br /><br />Popular Mechanics is, overall, a very nice publication that I will continue to read. I like the articles that emphasize fascinating innovation and achievement best, but I can also agree that the home and automotive articles are very practical and useful. The over- emphasis on automobiles is a small complaint about Popular Mechanics, but the magazine as a whole is very good and very readable.",[],B001THPA26,B001THPA26,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2010-08-27 16:03:00.000,2,False
3,Garden and Gun: The Allure of Southern Culture,"Garden and Gun is a magazine about Southern living, with a combination of articles that appeal to both women and men. This magazine covers a range of topics that can include everything from gardening to history to hunting and beyond.<br /><br />Garden and Gun is a magazine with an unusual title and this is the first aspect of the magazine that will catch your attention. What kind of a title is Garden and Gun? It sounds like some sort of twisted joke, but there is a reason for the unusual choice of title. It is intended to demonstrate the wide range of topics contained within and the balance between articles that appeal to men vs. articles that appeal to women, in contrast to most other southern reads which are often designed to appeal only to women. For the most part, this magazine succeeds with its balance, although there tend to be more articles related to gardens than to guns.<br /><br />Garden and Gun has a large number of departments and they include everything from cooking, to sports, to music, to fashion, and beyond. And, of course, they all relate to the American South. One department might focus on Southern eating while another will focus on Southern architecture. Each article concentrates on the southern way of doing things and how this part of the United States has its own particular means to achieve an end. The writing is good and often features comments and interviews from ordinary people who love their southern heritage and want to share it with the reader.<br /><br />Photography is important to any magazine and the photos in Garden and Gun add significantly to the magazine's appeal. The photos include a fair share of scenic places, but the appeal goes beyond that. The photos depicting ordinary things are just as interesting. The food, for example, is often photographed in a way that brings out the fine details of the featured dish and many will be impressed by how realistic it looks. You will also find interesting photographs taken in unheard of places. It could be a simple photo of a schoolhouse or a photo of an empty church. These are the types of photographs you don't expect to see in a magazine and, like a work of art, they get your imagination going.<br /><br />Garden and Gun tends to jump around with its articles, and this fact may not sit well with some readers. I find it okay, but one fact I wish was different is the magazine's tendency to play it safe and stick with topics that are non- controversial in nature. We all know that southern politics are known for their conservative bend and southerners often accept socially conservative beliefs as gospel truth. These topics of controversy would make for some great articles, but Garden and Gun tends to avoid this type of material and stick with whatever is safe. Even the articles about guns and hunting are presented in a non- confrontational way.<br /><br />Southerners have their own way of doing things and Garden and Gun does a good job capturing the soul of the American South. I like the photography most of all and there are some good departments in each issue. The publication has a few shortcomings, but it is good enough for the occasional read.",[],B000O1PKOG,B000O1PKOG,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2010-03-16 21:05:52.000,30,False
3,"Ready Made: Tacky, but Sometimes Fun and Interesting","Ready Made Magazine is a publication aimed at the young person who likes to create his/her own things, and these things could include anything from clothing, to furniture, to mixed drinks, and beyond. More than just a magazine about saving money, Ready Made is a publication that attempts to bring out the creative side in its readers with suggestions for making everyday items from ordinary goods.<br /><br />Ready Made spends most of its pages showing readers some unique ways to make things, and the suggestions range from the practical to the unusual. On the practical side, the magazine suggests making things like planters using coffee cans and vases using empty bottles. But then, there are some crafts that are not so obvious, like using a metal mixing bowl for a light fixture by inverting the bowl and attaching a light bulb from the inside. You never really know what unusual ideas Ready Made Magazine is going to offer in each issue, and this helps keep the magazine fresh and somewhat interesting.<br /><br />Judging Ready Made Magazine as a whole is sometimes difficult due to the nature of the publication. Creativity is certainly a good quality, but Ready Made Magazine gets a little too weird for my tastes. Suggestions for making your own soap, creating different foods, and making mixed drinks are fine and normal, but some of the suggested crafts are odd at best and extremely tacky at worst. Taking things like sandwich boxes, cookie tins, mail boxes, and other things and turning them into lights and other fixtures can result in some incredibly tacky décor. And the clothing suggestions are often too outrageous to be true. How many among us want to be seen wearing a skirt made from an old pillow case? Every now and then, Ready Made Magazine will surprise me with a recycled item that actually looks presentable but more often than not, the suggestions look a little too contemporary and non- traditional for my tastes.<br /><br />Ready Made Magazine is a publication that many will find entertaining, but usually for the wrong reasons. I like some of the articles on recipes and making household cleaners but the suggestions for do it yourself projects are often beyond the scope of good taste. You will end up either shaking your head in disbelief or enjoying a good laugh as you soak up the tackiness and wonder exactly who would really want some of these unusual items in their home or on their person. So, when all factors are considered, Ready Made adds up to an average magazine overall with an equal balance between good and bad points.",[],B000XXDJ8E,B000XXDJ8E,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2010-01-20 19:16:51.000,4,False
4,Improve Your Woodworking Knowledge and Skill,"Woodworking is a popular hobby and those who partake in this activity often turn to printed resources for new ideas, tips, etc. Wood Magazine is one publication designed to help woodworkers in several ways. It offers new techniques, new tools, and new projects for the budding or experienced woodworker who is seeking out ways to improve/develop their woodworking talents. Wood Magazine wants its readers to be educated and curious, and it offers articles that satisfy both desires.<br /><br />Wood Magazine's articles span a wide range, with some that cover basic tasks like cutting wood at an angle to more complicated tasks like carving unique shapes and patterns. One fact that readers will notice immediately is that Wood Magazine's articles are divided up so that woodworkers at all levels- from novice to expert- will find something to which they can relate. The articles tend to lean slightly toward the beginner to intermediate level, but there are certainly enough advanced articles in each issue to keep all woodworkers busy and satisfied.<br /><br />The articles in Wood Magazine are generally short, and they are often written in a step by step format, with illustrations and measurements (where applicable) to remove any guesswork from the process. These visual aspects and step/bulleted format make the magazine seem like a reference guide at times, but they are very useful for someone who wants to build one of the items and doesn't want to take any chances.<br /><br />If there is anything unattractive about Wood Magazine, it would have to be the high price. The cover price is high and there is little discount incentive when you sign up for a subscription. Also, this magazine is published only seven times per year. This latter fact could frustrate some woodworkers who want new and fresh ideas on a more frequent basis.<br /><br />Aside from the cost, however, Wood Magazine is a good magazine for woodworkers at all levels. The tips and tricks are useful, the education valuable, and the projects interesting and/or practical. It makes a good magazine for the occasional or serious woodworker who wants to develop one's skill and/or increase one's interest in the art of making things from wood. A little more length to the magazine and a lower price would be nice, but it is still a good magazine overall.",[],B00006LIR1,B00006LIR1,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2009-12-22 18:59:35.000,1,False
4,"Improve Your Knowledge, with Popular Science","Popular Science is a magazine I have been reading on and off for more than twenty years and it ranks as a science magazine for the masses. As most readers will tell you, Popular Science is a beginner's science publication and is generally intended for those who are curious about science and want to gain a better understanding of science and technology.<br /><br />Popular Science is more about technology than science and this is evident from the departments and most of the featured articles. Yes, Popular Science does include articles about atoms, chemicals, outer space, physics, etc., but the majority of the articles are about modern technology and its uses and applications. The technology articles are dedicated to subjects such as new vehicles, environmental trends, electronic devices, and more. Articles like these might seem a little out of scope, but one has to remember that the first word in the title of the magazine is Popular. Technology is huge, so it makes sense that the magazine would dedicate such a large percentage of its articles to high tech.<br /><br />The writing in Popular Science is very good, but as I said before, this magazine is intended more as a beginner's guide to science and technology. This means the articles will be perfectly fine for those with limited science and technology knowledge.  For those with a more advanced scientific mind, some of the articles may be too elementary. However, every issue can be counted on for at least a couple of in-depth, intellectual articles. Also, one needs to keep in mind that the articles are generally short and cover only a page or two. This is nice for those with shorter attention spans and for those who want to soak up as many facts about as many different things as possible.<br /><br />Learning more about science and technology is certainly a good idea and Popular Science is a good choice of reading material for those who are scientifically curious, want to improve their science knowledge level, and want to learn about the latest technology. The magazine could prove to be a little too simplistic for those with a working or educational background in science, but for everyone else, Popular Science presents a good means to keep up with the latest in science and high tech with writing that is clear and intelligent without going over the top.",[],B00005N7SC,B00005N7SC,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2009-12-12 04:11:42.000,5,False
4,Dwell Magazine Offers Unique Designs for the Home,"My mailbox overflows with magazines and among the themes, home and home- related topics are the most common. Dwell Magazine ranks as one of the better home magazines I read each month and it is one of only a few publications that I will return to throughout the month for entertainment and other purposes.<br /><br />What makes Dwell a unique publication is its dedication to more interesting and unusual home remodeling and rebuilding ideas. Other modern home magazines exist, but Dwell Magazine takes the idea of modern to a slightly different level than other, similar publications. With Dwell Magazine, the reader is presented with unusual homes, both on the exterior and interior, and many of them are certainly eye- catching, if nothing else. This magazine is all about homes that offer distinction and some of the design ideas are very interesting and will stick with you for a long time.<br /><br />Probably the most unique fact about Dwell Magazine is that, while it focuses on unusual and creative home design, it manages to maintain a level of livability. Other magazines that focus on unusual things- whether it's the home or something else- often take the weirdness factor to the extreme and they end up alienating most readers. But Dwell Magazine avoids making this mistake. The ideas it presents are unusual and creative, but still within the boundaries of taste and practicality.<br /><br />Magazines usually offer articles that cover a large range of topics each month, but one other interesting aspect of Dwell Magazine is that each magazine is based on a specific theme. This theme is clearly spelled out on the front cover, directly under the magazine's name, in bold letters. This is nice because you already have a good idea what to expect when you open the pages of any issue. The featured articles for the month will stick to the main theme for that particular issue.<br /><br />Dwell Magazine is one of hundreds of publications that focus on the home, but it easily stands out in the pack and I rank it among my favorites in this genre. I'm not into home design on a do-it-yourself level, but I do like to look at homes and the rooms within homes and I am always open to new ideas. Dwell Magazine offers plenty of creative ideas every month and it's a good magazine to consult for home makeover plans.",[],B00005NIRE,B00005NIRE,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2009-11-02 19:29:51.000,14,False
3,"Enjoy a Fantasy, with Yachting Magazine","Yachting Magazine is a publication dedicated to the acquisition of large sea going vessels and the enjoyment that spending time on a yacht can bring. This publication is all about big boats, with an emphasis that is divided between buying a yacht, comparing yacht performance, evaluating new models of yachts, and enjoying life to the fullest as the owner/operator of your own home on the water.<br /><br />Yachting Magazine is a magazine about luxury and it compares favorably to other, similar publications. Magazines about yachts are intended for an elite group of people for whom money is no object and Yachting Magazine is no different. The big boats talked about, tested, and offered for sale in the classified section usually sell for a minimum price of around half a million dollars and many of them sell for multiple millions of dollars, placing the bulk of the magazine's promoted material out of the reach of most individuals.<br /><br />Even though yachting magazine is impractical for most people, there are a few nice features with Yachting Magazine and at the top of the list is the photography. Not only do you get to gaze in awe at these incredible aquatic machines, you also get to enjoy great photographs of beautiful lakes, oceans, and rivers where yachts of different sizes can often be found. These photographs set the imagination soaring and they rank as the magazine's number one asset. Second to the photographs are the travel articles. Again, they usually feature some nice photography, not to mention a few travel secrets from coastal and/or riverfront cities around the world.<br /><br />As for the writing in Yachting Magazine, it is generally good, but other than the articles mentioned above, most of the material in this publication is too simplistic and/or irrelevant to the bulk of the population. For example, the evaluations of new make/model of yachts are often very lacking, offering only a one page summary, which isn't nearly enough to make an informed buying decision. Worse from a practical standpoint, the vessels the magazine features are usually in the one million+ dollar price range. This is fantasy material for most people. The yachts are nice to look at and fantasize about, but unless I receive a pay raise in the one- thousand percent range, there is practically no chance that I will be purchasing a multi- million dollar yacht any time soon.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, Yachting Magazine is an acceptable publication that I will continue to read solely for its eye- candy properties. I really like the photography and the magazine can sometimes impress with a few of its travel articles. But other than that, Yachting Magazine is a fantasy read, pure and simple. Even though the photographs are great and they can set your imagination on fire, the magazine is an impractical read for most with more fantasy material than your favorite adult movie.",[],B00006LE7S,B00006LE7S,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2009-08-20 19:43:47.000,17,False
4,Rich People Love Their Toys,"The Robb Report is an amusing yet very professional magazine aimed at those with too much money and too few things to buy. This publication features outrageously priced merchandise and let's you, the reader, gaze in awe at some of the ways in which the fabulously wealthy spend their excess cash.<br /><br />I have been enjoying the Robb Report for about a year now and as I read each issue, I find myself alternating between various emotions. On one hand, the magazine offers a fascinating glimpse inside the buying world of the filthy rich. On the other hand, one has to wonder what would convince someone to spend huge sums of money on merchandise that, while certainly high in prestige, could still be obtained for much less money without sacrificing much quality. I realize the incredibly rich like their toys and need something on which to spend their cash, but some of these items go way over the top, to put it mildly. Items such as eight hundred dollar sunglasses or five thousand dollar watches are often highlighted in the pages of the Robb Report and while they certainly capture one's imagination, you have to question what would convince a person to spend so lavishly.<br /><br />Even though the Robb Report is a fantasy read for most people, it still has much to offer and one thing I like about this magazine is the writing. Not only is it top- notch, but these individuals really know what they are talking about and they are able to keep the writing on a level that makes living the good life seem ordinary. In other words, this magazine doesn't read like a shock piece- it assumes that the reader is already well- acquainted with living a life of luxury and may not even be that impressed by a one- thousand dollar writing utensil or a fifteen thousand dollar set of golf clubs. Another great quality of the Robb Report is the photography. It is absolutely superb, with illustrations that are vivid, clear, and inspiring in a fantasy type of way.<br /><br />Rich people like their toys, just like everyone else and the Robb Report fulfills their needs by presenting a quality magazine that is flawlessly written and exquisitely illustrated. It is a fantasy read for most people, but it performs its main mission quite nicely: Spotlighting extremely expensive merchandise for the highly affluent and offering a glimpse inside the lifestyle that many of the world's super rich enjoy every day.",[],B00005NIOP,B00005NIOP,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2009-07-17 18:02:00.000,2,False
4,Poets and Writers Offers Inspiration and a Peak Into Writing Culture,"Writers are usually on the lookout for information. They want to know how to succeed at the business of writing. They want to know how to promote themselves. They want tips and advice for success. Most turn to the world wide web for this, similar information but there are still a few traidtional avenues for writing advice, and one of them is magazines. Among magazines for writers, Poets & Writers Magazine is one of the better choices available. It brings the world of writing to your fingertips every two months with helpful articles about writing style, publication challenges, etc., along with interviews from established writers who are ready to share their secrets.<br /><br />Poets & Writers Magazine concentrates a large percentage of its articles and advice on the world of poetry, so it makes a valuable resource for those who specialize in writing poems and want to expand on their talents. It also emphasizes fictional writing and each issue can be counted on for at least one interview with a famous or semi- famous fiction writer/poet. These writers are ready to share their successes and challenges with the reader and many will find these articles personable and inspiring.<br /><br />With the emphasis on fiction, some people might come away from Poets & Writers Magazine with a feeling of disappointment. I am one of those people who read and write nothing but non- fiction, so I was a little disappointed when I discovered that Poets & Writers contained so little material for non- fiction writers. However, I can still see the value of this magazine for all writers. Going back to the articles about specific writers, for example, one can quickly read about their struggles, successes, failures, etc. and relate them to any type of writing. And while there are not as many tips and advice columns as there are in other writing publications, there are still a few and they are pretty good, even if usually very general and obvious.<br /><br />Poets & Writers Magazine contains plenty of advertisements. The ads focus on writing conferences, publishers, university degree programs, writing workshops, writing retreats, and other events. Some might argue that the pages contain too many advertisements, but since writers who read writing magazines are usually looking for ways to promote themselves, improve their education level, and perfect their art, it makes sense that advertisements are such an important part of the magazine. I know some people who grab a copy of Poets & writers magazine solely for the advertisements, so I cannot necessarily say this is a con. Unusual is the writer who doesn't want to grow and expand his/her craft through promotion and education so it makes sense that advertising is so prevalent in this type of magazine.<br /><br />Poets & Writers Magazine is a useful publication for writers- particularly those who write poetry and general fiction. The magazine is published entirely in black and white, except for the cover photo and some of the advertisements, and it offers a good deal of length per issue for your reading enjoyment. It is a magazien about writing culture as well as writing education and promotion and while it would be nice if it included more information for non- fiction writers, it still has many good things to offer and it makes a great gift choice for the aspiring poet and/or fictional author.",[],B00006KT0K,B00006KT0K,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2009-06-29 04:54:14.000,3,False
4,For Intense Basketball Fans Only,"Dime Magazine is a publication that is all about basketball and the personalities who have helped shape the sport and have helped make it a popular part of our entertainment and culture. This magazine is unique in that it focuses only on the sport of basketball. Most all other popular sporting magazines cover all types of sports from football to tennis and everything in between. But Dime Magazine is one- hundred percent basketball and it devotes its pages to the men and women behind the sport and what they are like when not playing the game. There is some talk about the sport itself, but Dime Magazine digs deeper than that. It strives to let the reader know about the basketball people themselves; what they are like, what they believe in, what their family life is like, etc.<br /><br />Dime Magazine covers basketball in every form, including college, NBA, WNBA, and world competition, but the majority of the articles cover the NBA and its many dazzling stars. Occasionally, Dime Magazine will offer an article on a woman who plays college hoops or a rising basketball star in another part of the world. But most of the stories revolve around the personalities that make the NBA what it is today. These personal stories are often very frank and very to the point. As most fans already know, the NBA has some very unique and powerful personalities among its personnel and these men do not hold back their feelings and do not resist massaging their own egos. They let you know exactly what they think, whether it's about basketball or some other subject.<br /><br />Dime Magazine is a very consistent magazine. Each issue contains about the same number of pages with sections laid out in roughly the same way. One quality that many will appreciate is the lack of advertisements. There is a fashion section near the end which is like an advertisement, but other than this, Dime Magazine devotes most of its pages to stories and interviews with the players. This publication wants to keep basketball enthusiasts informed about some of the most interesting players in the game and it wastes little time or magazine space deviating from its main purpose.<br /><br />Basketball fans are often die- hard and many individuals live and breathe the sport they love. Dime Magazine is a great publication for these intense fans of basketball because it goes much deeper than the game itself. Basketball is fun to watch, but there is more to the game than what one witnesses on the court. There are also the personalities that have helped shape the game of basketball and Dime Magazine is a nice publication for reading about and learning more about the interesting men and woman who have helped make basketball the cultural phenomenon that it is today.",[],B000069YWG,B000069YWG,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2009-01-13 16:56:44.000,5,False
3,Build Your Dream Aircraft with Kitplanes,"Kitplanes is a different kind of magazine and one that will only appeal to a limited audience. This magazine is intended for those who love airplanes and whose interest in airplanes reaches a level that goes beyond simply flying. Kitplanes takes aviation to a different level for a magazine by focusing on actually building aircraft. Kitplanes is more than just a mechanical read- it is also a creative read that explores the different ways that small aircraft can be built, the different designs, and the different styles and capabilities.<br /><br />Most of the pages in Kitplanes are dedicated to design and construction. From the initial mental blueprint to the proper hardware, Kitplanes wants to help the enthusiastic hobbyist construct the dream machine. Some of the articles in Kitplanes are educational in nature, focusing on the specifics of aerodynamics, the pros and cons of using different types of metals, etc. The magazine even includes some success stories from builders who have completed their aircraft construction and want to share their results with the reader.<br /><br />Mechanics are important, but in the day and age in which we live, technology is more important than ever and Kitplanes is right there to help. Small aircraft isn't as sophisticated as commercial aircraft, but the aircraft building hobbyist still wants to be as safe as possible, and Kitplanes offers plenty of tips on instrument panels, safety systems, and other things high tech in nature.<br /><br />One other interesting aspect of Kitplanes is that it's a very consistent magazine. Each issue I have read contains exactly 80 pages and the departments and most of the regular features are found on exactly the same page number each month. For those who like consistency and repetition, this is a nice feature for a magazine. But this will not sit well with people who like a little variety from time to time. I am one of the types who like some variety in my magazines, so the consistency is a strike against the magazine, even if only a small strike.<br /><br />Kitplanes is, overall, a pretty good magazine about a very expensive hobby. I find the articles pretty good, even though some are certainly better than others. Some are a little too brief and assume the builder needs guidance from start to finish but Kitplanes is still a useful magazine for those who dream about constructing their own airplane. It does have a few shortfalls, but for the flying enthusiast who dreams of constructing his/her own aircraft, Kitplanes is a magazine worth reading.",[],B00008GT1F,B00008GT1F,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2008-12-31 18:07:54.000,8,False
3,Balancing Work and Home,"Pink is a business magazine for women. It's a publication written and targeted to the successful career woman and it's a magazine I have been glancing through for the past several years. Pink discusses a myriad of topics that are important to the career female, including success and advancement in the workplace, to balance between home and career, to staying healthy so that the working woman can enjoy the fruits of her labor. This is a magazine that aims to show that women can be a successful business professional while also maintaining her sense of femininity. Traditional female traits and business success do not have to be mutually exclusive ideas. They can co- exist, and many women are quickly realizing that they, too,  can be soft and feminine while also holding a position of high prestige in their place of business.<br /><br />Because Pink is about business, a large number of the pages in each issue are dedicated to career development and some of these articles can offer good advice and inspiring wisdom. These success stories rank among the best articles in each issue. These women are ready to share their climb to the top with the reader, explaining what worked and what didn't work; the obstacles faced; and the ways in which they learned to balance their success in the workplace with their family life and other job as a concerned mother and parent.<br /><br />Most of the departments and other material in Pink are pretty good and there is some sound advice that can apply to anyone, whether male or female. But I must admit that I do get a little tired of the seeming battle of the sexes component of this magazine. Many of the articles deal with career obstacles, and this is fine. But they often portray the women as victims or possible victims; otherwise intelligent people who have to overcome many additional obstacles due to being a woman- obstacles that men supposedly do not need to worry about. The magazine almost seems to pit one side against the other and even if it is intended in an educational way, it takes away from the value of the magazine. I would rather read the positive aspects of being a career woman and how women have faced the challenges presented by their profession, regardless of whether the so- called obstacle is a man or a woman.<br /><br />Pink is, overall, a pretty good magazine for the career women who also has a family and wants to learn new ways to balance these competing realms of her life. It does tend to emphasize the male vs. female aspect of work a little more than I would prefer and when it does this, it sometimes makes the women seem like victims. But when Pink is sharing female business success stories or dispensing advice, it is a solid magazine that most any professional woman will appreciate and this fact alone makes Pink a publication worth reading.",[],B000K7KJXQ,B000K7KJXQ,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2008-11-09 21:55:12.000,2,False
4,Can't Curb Your Enthusiasm? Read Cycle World!,"Motorcycle enthusiasts are a unique breed and the main quality that sets them apart from the rest of civilization is their unyielding enthusiasm for their chosen sport/hobby. They often become consumed with biking and, like golf fanatics and others, they view every spare moment as an excuse to partake in their chosen activity.<br /><br />Cycle World is a magazine designed with the motorcycle enthusiast in mind. This publication is made for the type of biker who not only likes to ride his cycle, but also liked to learn as much about motorcycles as possible. There are, of course, plenty of articles in each issue of Cycle World that talk about the joys of riding and the sport of motorcycle racing. But Cycle World includes other articles, too- articles that only the well- rounded motorcycle fan will be likely to read and appreciate. Some articles focus on new technology. Others dispense advice on motorcycle repair. There are also travel articles and personality profiles as well, making for a nicely rounded publication.<br /><br />I'm not a motorcycle enthusiast or even a casual fan, but I still like certain sections of Cycle World and I try to read a few of them every month. My favorite sections of Cycle World are those that feature new products. Cycle World is among the first publications to report on new motorcycles and other related products and the magazine includes plenty of great photos, test data, and various statistics. In a matter of minutes, one can quickly learn the pros and cons of a specific motorcycle and more easily make a buying decision. Even though I am not a fan, I still like these articles because, like articles on new cars, they often include some very cool new product offerings that can easily impress anyone- even a nonfan like me.<br /><br />Motorcycles are loved by their many enthusiastic fans and Cycle World is a magazine intended for those who want a well- rounded publication about motorcycles, their upkeep, and their use for entertainment. Most of the pages in each issue are dedicated to the different motorcycles produced by different manufacturers, but there is plenty other information to be found in this magazine about motorcycles and Cycle World makes a good choice for those who want to know how to ride, repair, and enjoy their hobby as much as possible.",[],B00007AWME,B00007AWME,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2008-10-29 18:43:18.000,4,False
3,Learn the Tools of the Writing Trade,"Writer's Digest is a magazine designed for writers and it attempts to cover many different aspects of writing in its columns and featured articles. Most every issue offers at least one interview with a famous or semi- famous author. This spotlighted author could be the author of a book, a screen writer, or some other type of author. These interviews offer some good insight into writing success and the necessary skills and sacrifices to succeed at your chosen craft.<br /><br />Aside from the interviews, Writer's Digest is basically a magazine of tips and advice. One issue might talk about ways to break into the business of movie reviewing for newspapers. Another might talk about ways to make your writing more concise and less wordy. Still another article might discuss ways to overcome writer's block. The main goal of Writer's Digest is to help the reader become a better writer and, hopefully, gain an offer for a publication at some point in the future.<br /><br />One thing that is a little different with Writer's Digest is that it doesn't contain the long list of standard monthly departments like you find in other magazines. With Writer's Digest, the departments are de-emphasized and there are only a few of them in each issue. The rest of Writer's Digest is dedicated to columns and featured articles. This format is unique and it makes Writer's Digest a good choice for those who like change and prefer to read something different in each issue.<br /><br />Writer's Digest does contain a pretty good number of advertisements, but the ads are usually for writing conferences, writing software, writing contests, or ads that encourage a visit to the magazine's own web site. Because the ads stay so focused on the subject of writing, they don't seem all that bad and they are not distracting. I know some Writer's Digest readers who actually look forward to the ads so that they can find information on the latest contests. And speaking of the magazine's web site, it seems to be an important component of the magazine because it is referenced on many pages throughout each issue.<br /><br />Writer's Digest is a pretty good magazine for writer and I like it for its advice and classified ads more than anything. The success stories can sometimes get a bit carried away and they make it look a little too easy to land a huge writing contract. It would also be nice if Writer's Digest was published monthly rather than semi- monthly. But Writer's Digest is still a good magazine for writers everywhere, with plenty of good advice and tips to help you become the writer you always knew you could be.",[],B00005NIPH,B00005NIPH,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2008-08-26 16:07:27.000,5,False
4,Modern Country Decor,"Country Home is a magazine that does all it can to bring the country home to you, regardless of what type of setting in which you presently live. I am a city slicker all the way and I certainly have no interest in selling my home and purchasing a farm. But I still like Country Home magazine for several reasons. Most important of all, I like that Country Home doesn't completely push the country look and/or country lifestyle. This was a pleasant surprise when I started to read Country Home because, based on the name, I was expecting a magazine that was all about the country lifestyle, complete with recipes for grits, outhouse remodeling tips, and ideas for purchasing the best wicker furniture. But Country Home isn't like that at all. This magazine is certainly country- oriented, but it emphasizes a more modern country look for the home that can be applied to most any household, regardless of location.<br /><br />Country Home offers several different sections and different monthly features but the theme that the magazine continues to return to is that of home decorating. Turn to different sections of Country Home and you are most likely to see articles on antiques, collectibles, flowers, and other like items and how their inclusion can make your home look better. There are also some recipes offered in different parts of Country Home, and they offer some interesting recipes made southern style.<br /><br />Country Home certainly attempts to keep its country roots at a modern level, but that doesn't mean you won't find anything that is truly down home in the pages of Country Home. There are some very rustic suggestions for home decor in the pages of Country Home and some of them will likely turn off the majority of city- dwelling readers. When I read Country Home, I tend to flip past these articles because they are a little too down on the farm for my tastes. The other articles about home decorating are at least modern looking enough to consider, even though it is doubtful I would ever adopt one of the styles mentioned in this magazine.<br /><br />Country Home is, overall, a very good magazine and, coming from someone like me, that says a lot considering I have little or no interest in country life or the country theme for home decor. The reason I like the magazine regardless is because of the writing, the antique articles, the occasional travel article, and the collectibles ideas, not to mention the recipes. Combined together, Country Home offers a total greater than the sum of its parts and it makes for a very appealing magazine.",[],B000UHI32U,B000UHI32U,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2008-07-26 04:56:52.000,3,False
4,Intellectually Stimulating and Highly Anticipated Each Month,"The Atlantic is an intellectual magazine and one that I have been reading on and off for many years. This magazine is best known for its political/current events/social articles that tackle some tough issues of the day and it delivers most effectively when it's offering some commentary on world events and social issues and these are the articles I turn to first when I read The Atlantic. I like the political articles best, but there are plenty of other non- political yet very thoughtful articles in each issue.<br />Most every article in The Atlantic is thoughtful and well- written. Look closely at the authors of some of the stories in this magazine and you will notice some high- profile names on more than one occasion. Christopher Hitchens, Mark Bowden, Eric Schlosser, and others are known to contribute an article or two in each issue of The Atlantic. These writers, and others like them, are ready to offer their take on some of the critical issues of the day.<br /><br />The Atlantic certainly offers some interesting, thoughtful, intellectual articles and one fact that sets them apart from those found in most other magazines is that the featured articles are often very long- sometimes exceeding ten pages in length. Most magazines shy away from articles this long because they know that most reader's have an attention span that is far too short to finish the entire piece of reading in one sitting. But The Atlantic is different. If the subject matter is such that an article needs to be ten- plus pages in order to thoroughly cover everything, then The Atlantic is quick to oblige. I appreciate the excellent coverage but I must admit that some articles are almost too long. Even when I have an interest in the subject matter, I often end up stopping halfway through because I cannot hold my attention any longer.<br /><br />Another section I like in The Atlantic is the book reviews section. To present a fair and balanced perspective, The Atlantic reviews new books from many different genres and I like that there are different reviews of varying lengths. One section of The Atlantic called Cover to Cover includes short summaries of many different books. These are nice when you don't have time to read a lengthy review of a book and just want the basics. But there are also some very long book reviews in The Atlantic, along with some advertisements for new books that include a short, 50 to 100 word summary of the book. I like reading the reviews, but I like this section best for its exposure to new book releases. It is like looking at a quick rundown of intellectual books and I have, in fact, discovered some very good titles from this part of the magazine.<br /><br />Overall, The Atlantic ranks among my favorite magazines and I look forward to some serious, intellectual reading in each issue. I admit that some articles are a tad too lengthy, but I still like The Atlantic for its intellectual stimulation and for its focus on current events. It's a very good magazine for cerebral types who like to read about politics and social issues.",[],B000UHI2LW,B000UHI2LW,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2008-06-25 18:41:50.000,21,False
4,Barron's Offers Timely Financial Updates and Great Writing,"Barron's is a popular magazine/newspaper that helps investors keep abreast of financial markets, industry news, economic trends, profit forecasts, and other related topics. This publication bills itself as the magazine of the Dow Jones, and it offers investors and other financial gurus some solid and timely financial reading.<br /><br />Many people who read Barron's head directly to the Market Week section in order to catch up on the latest investment prices. Each weekly issue of Barron's offers plenty of stock tables, Commodities Pricing, Options market pricing, etc., so it makes sense that a concerned investor would turn to this section first, in order to check investment prices. But Barron's is much more than a collection of statistical tables. Each issue contains a large number of featured articles and regular columns and there are very few departments. The bulk of each issue is dedicated to short articles about specific companies, economic concerns, innovative technology, Wall Street trends, and other noteworthy topics.<br /><br />Barron's is a very expensive publication, but among its many good points is the fact that it is published weekly and therefore is very up to date and timely. If you're an investor, you are fully aware of the importance of timely information and Barron's provides exactly that. Whether the subject is the high price of oil, corporate takeovers, or volatile interest rates, Barron's is right there, offering a timely article about the important issues of the day.<br />One other noticeable fact about Barron's is that devotes only a minimal amount of space to advertisements. There are some ads, and they are usually clustered in the first part of each issue. Most all of the ads are relevant to the subject matter of the magazine, and it is common to see ads for insurance companies, mutual funds, brokerage services, and the like. Because the ads are almost all about finance, they tend to blend into the articles and you do not notice them like you notice the ads in other magazines.<br /><br />Investors, financial professionals, and concerned citizens like to keep up to date on financial and economic affairs and for these individuals, Barron's ranks as one of the best financial publications available today. The articles are quite thorough for such a short magazine and while some articles can get a little too advanced for the novice investor, there is still much to be learned in every issue of Barron's. Timely financial data, great writing, and relevant articles make Barron's a magazine worth reading for those with an interest in the subject of finance and investments.",[],B00006F2SY,B00006F2SY,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2008-03-21 15:33:26.000,20,False
4,Maximizing Electronics Enjoyment,"Maximum PC is a magazine for electronics freaks, offering many different articles about electronics; how to buy them, how to repair them, how to get the most out of them, and how best to replace them. This magazine is aimed in one primary direction: Making the most out of the electronic devices available. This is accomplished through the many instructional articles, how to guides, and question and answer sessions.<br /><br />When Maximum PC isn't offering words of wisdom on ways to improve your life with electronics, the magazine is usually offering reviews of new products. The reviews section is one of the largest parts of each issue and while it does a nice job bringing new products to the forefront, the reviews are often less than stellar. Rather than analyze a few products in- depth, Maximum PC instead prefers to offer shorter reviews of many products. This part of the magazine seems more concerned with quantity than quality, in contrast to most of the remainder of the magazine.<br /><br />One thing about Maximum PC that isn't to my liking is the technical nature of many articles. Maximum PC likes to get to the root of things (literally), and it is common to find articles talking about circuits, memory, and other boring subjects. This is fine for those who take their technology to the extremes, but I have no interest in learning about the inter-workings of the wiring inside my personal computer or the electronic pulses that cause my printer to respond on queue. This is a little too much technology for me, but I know there are some readers who will relish the depths that Maximum PC goes to when it strips down electronic devices into their component parts.<br /><br />Overall, Maximum PC is a pretty good electronics magazine for young and middle- aged adults. It loses me from time to time when it gets overly technical, but it still ranks as a good magazine about electronics. The numerous question and answer sessions, the educational articles, and the product reviews make this a magazine worth reading.",[],B00005N7P0,B00005N7P0,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2007-09-24 20:26:42.000,2,False
3,Making Your Living Space More Livable,"This Old House is a magazine dedicated to home improvement. Based on the popular PBS television program, this magazine aims to help its readers find new and better ways to improve the home and perform routine maintenance.<br /><br />Magazines and the internet are my primary sources when home repair reaches the critical point. This Old House is one of several magazines I like to read and it is the one I turn to most frequently when I need to find out about home maintenance. The majority of other home- related publications deal strictly with enhancements, remodeling, and general improvement. This Old House offers these types of articles, along with articles on general home repair, landscaping techniques, utility cost savings, and more.<br /><br />My favorite departments in This Old House are ""Around the House"", ""Toolbox"", and ""Salvage"". The last department, Salvage, sounds boring at first but it often gets very creative. This department selects a common household item- usually one that is probably slated to get tossed in the trash- and points out a creative way to re- use the item. Some of the ideas they come up with are surprising, making this one of the first sections I turn to when I get a new issue in the mail.<br /><br />Some parts of This Old House are not appealing at all, either because the suggestions are far too costly for someone like me; because they involve skills that I do not possess; or a combination of the two. The Luxury department is one such area. Another is the Design sections. These areas are intended for the more advanced home improver who has advanced skills at home design. There are some very expensive suggestions, too, and these parts of the magazine provide more fantasy reading than anything. However, there are still enough less expensive ideas to keep the magazine useful and practical.<br /><br />Overall, This Old House is a good magazine that offers some home improvement ideas, some repair suggestions, and some ways to enhance your home's value. The general repair advice is pretty handy and while I don't have much use for other parts of the magazine, I can agree that these are helpful to the right type of person. It makes This Old House a good publication for those who seek advice for home repair and home enhancement.",[],B00005R8BL,B00005R8BL,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2007-09-18 21:47:46.000,2,False
4,Smart Money Combines Business and Personal Finance,"Smart Money is a solid magazine about business and finance and I have been reading it on and off again for the past five years. This magazine is a little bit big business and a little bit personal finance, combining together the features of a business magazine with that of an investment publication.<br /><br />One of the main things I like about Smart Money is the fact that it includes so many different articles each month. There are only a few regular departments in this magazine. The majority of the pages include featured articles and short articles that change from month to month. These articles can cover a wide range of topics from ways to cut your electric bill to the latest regulations in the insurance industry.<br /><br />Smart Money is an intelligent magazine and its articles are often a little more advanced than those of other financial publications. They don't reach a level that is too advanced to make them incapable of understanding, and that is good. But they are certainly intended for the savvier investor who already knows the ropes and wants some more specific, intermediate to advanced advice on personal finance and corporate happenings.<br /><br />Overall, I rank Smart Money as a very good personal finance magazine and it is one I will continue to read when I get the chance. It is like a combination of Fortune and Money magazines and its timely articles are often very interesting and helpful. Whether it's an article on reducing your cell phone bill or an article about the profit picture in the oil business, Smart Money is certain to inform and enlighten.",[],B00005N7SS,B00005N7SS,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2007-07-12 09:59:42.000,19,False
4,"Well- Polished, Professional Magazine","Opera News is a magazine dedicated to opera and the individual talents that contribute to the full opera production. This magazine offers a way to find out dates for upcoming operas; backgrounds on some of the more popular opera stars; reviews of operas and opera related media; interviews; etc.<br /><br />I am not a man of the arts by any stretch and it's a rare day that finds me sitting in a theater seat, watching a bunch of stage performers sing and dance. But I still like Opera News nonetheless and I can understand fully why fans of opera enjoy it so much. It covers the big operas, the big stars, and much more.<br /><br />Articles about specific performers are common in this magazine but Opera News isn't just a magazine about opera performers and the long hours they labor for their chosen profession. No, this magazine offers more than that and there is something for any lover of entertainment to enjoy. There are plenty of reviews of operas, DVD, CD, and books; interviews with stars; and plenty of news and official information. The fact that the name of the magazine includes the word ""News"" is no accident, for Opera News is exactly that: a news source for all things opera and opera related.<br /><br />Since I have limited interest in watching operas, I tend to gloss over the interviews and bios (I have no idea who these people are anyway). My favorite sections are those that cover news stories and the reviews at the end of the magazine. The news articles are usually good and I like the featured articles that talk about opera history and other like topics. And, as an avid reader, I like reading the book reviews even though I am unlikely to ever purchase one of these books.<br /><br />Overall, Opera News is a magazine that every opera lover should read. I am not a fan of opera and theater but even I have found some reading value with this magazine. Its subject is one with limited appeal, but its value is obvious, even to someone like me who has little interest in this topic.",[],B00005N7XO,B00005N7XO,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2007-06-11 20:34:08.000,6,False
4,Reeling in a Record - Setting Catch,"Bassmaster is a magazine about fishing and it likes to boast that it is the ""Worldwide Authority on Bass Fishing"". This magazine divides its focus among different areas, like finding/fishing for bass, buying the best equipment, and keeping pace with the different sporting tournaments that focus on bass fishing.<br /><br />I spend very little time participating in outdoor sports but I have been known to cast a reel over an expanse of water on an infrequent occasion. With Bassmaster, consumers like me can quickly get the information needed to find places to fish for bass. There is also plenty of tips and advice from Bassmaster magazine and from fishing professionals. They clue you in on the right environment and weather conditions for bass fishing, the best equipment to use, and the most effective lure to improve your chances for landing that prized catch.<br /><br />Bassmaster is like other sporting magazines in many ways, but it differs a little from other fishing magazines, mainly in its coverage of the sport of bass fishing. Part of the reason for the emphasis on sports is Bassmaster's affiliation with sports authority ESPN.  ESPN is the main reason the sporting aspect gets the amount of coverage in Bassmaster that it does and it helps make the magazine that much better to read.<br /><br />Bassmaster is loaded with different departments and among all the magazines I read each month, Bassmaster probably has more departments than any other publication of similar length. The departments are short- usually covering only one page each- but they offer some of the magazine's best and easiest to read material. Departments like ""Ask the Experts"", ""Bass Basics"", and others are good for finding some quick information on fishing and how to make it more enjoyable and more successful. I like the Destinations section, too, because it offers some information on lakes and rivers that would make good choices for vacationing as well as fishing.<br /><br />I don't fish very often and I'm not someone that would be classified as an outdoorsman, but I still like Bassmaster magazine. It offers some good writing and compelling articles about bass fishing, both as a casual hobby and as a competitive sport. If someone like me- a person who doesn't even fish very much- can find reasons to enjoy reading a magazine like Bassmaster, just think of how much a true fan of this activity will like this publication. It's one of the better fishing magazines and it makes a good choice of gift for a dedicated fisherman; offering plenty of good reading each month all for a low subscription cost.",[],B000EQ4010,B000EQ4010,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2007-04-07 23:28:54.000,6,False
3,"GQ: Different From the Past, but Still Okay","GQ magazine has been around for a long time and, like other men's magazines, it has changed over the years. In an effort to attract more readers, GQ has spiced up some of its articles with more sex and it is common to find a scantily clad female on the cover- a place that used to be reserved exclusively for men. This isn't to say that the articles have suffered greatly from the changeover. There are still several good articles in each issue of GQ, combined with a few too many articles about relationships.<br /><br />When GQ is at its best is when the magazine is talking politics, entertainment, and/or culture. I have read many interesting political articles in GQ, ranging from topics like homeland security to men's rights when it comes to abortion. The entertainment articles are also quite good and the GQ team can be counted on to deliver some good, frank discussion about movies, books, movies, Hollywood celebrities, etc.<br /><br />GQ used to seem a little more fashion oriented than it is today. There are still several fashion related articles in each issue but the difference is that the GQ of today contains articles in a wider range of topics than in the past. This is fine by me, because the fashion articles rank low on my list of reading priorities. I would much rather read, say, an article that debates the efforts to ban smoking than an article about buying the right shoes to wear in a business casual workplace.<br /><br />Many magazines skimp when it comes to reading material but not GQ. You get your money's worth with this magazine. Each issue is the length of a book, with anywhere from 250 to 350 or more pages per issue and from 25 to 30 different featured articles, departments, and monthly columns to read (combined). This makes for a lot of reading. Even of you take the advertisement space into account, there is still plenty to read in each issue. It also means that, whatever your fancy, you should find something interesting to read every month.<br /><br />Overall, GQ is a good magazine for men and it contains some decent entertainment news, political analysis, and fashion tips. It is aimed at men in their early thirties and while I don't like it as much as similar publications I still think GQ is a decent magazine. Its long length makes it easily worth the low cost and with so much reading material, there is something for everyone in each issue. What others have said is true: It isn't the magazine it once was. But there is still enough of the good stuff to recommend this publication.",[],B00005N7QI,B00005N7QI,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2007-03-31 01:57:24.000,5,False
3,"Antiques Magazine is Good, but not for Everyone","Antiques Magazine is a publication made for antique lovers and history buffs and its pages are loaded with photos of artistic paintings, handmade goods, rare pictures, and other items of similar nature. It is a magazine for those who love antiques and also those who consider themselves historians since many articles deal with historical collections of art and antiques.<br /><br />This magazine is overflowing with antique goods and information. The articles contained in this magazine are intended to be visually stimulating in some cases, educational in others. They offer history lessons on the art that was popular during a specific era, a glimpse into an art collection at a museum, and more. The articles are meant to stimulate the interests of those who already like this subject and they often provide a means to learn more, to discover places to see or purchase some of the featured works, and to develop an appreciation for the craftsmanship that went into making these items.<br /><br />Antiques Magazine is a publication dedicated to creative art and history but one thing that isn't very creative is the titles of the articles. This might surprise some readers at first, but the editors at Antiques decided to get straight to the point in the naming of the featured articles rather than try to be creative. The features thus have titles like ""The Eating Utensil Collection"", ""Spanish Culture in Art"", etc. Each title points out exactly what the article covers, leaving nothing to the imagination.<br /><br />The writing in Antiques is certainly good and well- edited. But I'm afraid that many readers will find the articles a little boring. They describe things well and they usually offer a good history lesson. But they lack spark and readability. I have tried to read some articles in this magazine and found my eyelids getting heavy and my thoughts drifting to other subjects. This is why I generally stick with the pictures when I glance at Antiques Magazine. I don't bother reading because most of the material doesn't keep my interest.<br /><br />Overall, Antiques Magazine is an okay publication and unless you have a deep interest in antiques and their history, you will likely become bored quickly if you try to read the articles. But the pictures in Antiques are often very interesting. Even if you have little interest in reading a magazine like this one, the photos alone make it worth an occasional look.",[],B00005N7OJ,B00005N7OJ,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2007-03-24 19:10:05.000,13,False
3,Your Guide to Improvement,"If you are the type of golfer who wants to improve your putting, your swing, your choice of equipment, or anything else golf related, then Golf Tips is the magazine for you. This magazine, unlike other golf publications, dedicates almost all of its pages to improvement. Most every golfer wants to get better over time, and Golf Tips is one of the few publications available that focuses all of its contents on self improvement.<br /><br />As far as the advice goes, Golf Tips is a good magazine and it tries to cover several different aspects of the game in the same issue, so readers can find a relevant article that relates to their own problems. Maybe your problem area is putting. If it is, there is likely a putting article someone in the current issue. Another person might be having trouble perfecting his/her swing and if so, there are plenty of helpful articles that include diagrams so readers will know exactly what to do.<br /><br />Other magazines include diagrams to illustrate proper maneuvering of the hands and body when swinging a golf club but Golf Tips takes this a step further. It includes not only picture depicting the right way to do it, there are also pictures showing what not to do. With some of these, Golf Tips will make sure the casual reader knows which photo depicts the wrong way to swing by showing a red circle with a line through it (same symbol seen on certain traffic signs), superimposed over the picture. With an illustration like this, there will be no doubt in the golfer's mind what he/she is not supposed to do.<br /><br />Overall, Golf Tips is a good magazine for someone whose primary interest is improving his/her game. There are other magazines that include some instruction on the game, but Golf Tips concentrates most all of its pages in this area. I prefer a more balanced golf magazine like Golf Digest but I can see how Golf Tips could come in handy. The advice is written like a pro, and it covers something about many different problems in each and every issue.",[],B00006J9HV,B00006J9HV,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2007-03-24 18:59:38.000,15,False
3,Wired for the Modern World,"Wired is a semi- interesting magazine that blends together articles about technology with those on politics, culture, and more. This magazine is aimed at a diverse audience but it generally caters to those who are technology savvy and like to keep up with the latest world events.<br /><br />Wired dedicates most of its pages to the discussion of electronics and other technology and computer nerds form a large percentage of the magazine's core subscribers. Articles about digital cameras, high definition televisions, internet marketing, and other like topics can be found in every issue. These articles often present unique angles on common problems and concerns in the world of high tech.<br /><br />What makes Wired interesting is the fact that it includes other articles on other subjects- topics that one normally would not associate with a technology magazine. It is common to find articles about popular culture, politics, and other topics and they sometimes seem out of place. One minute you're reading an article about PDA's and the next minute you're reading an article about the war against Iraq. It's a little weird but it also makes for a nice change of pace as you read.<br /><br />Another interesting fact with Wired is that it changes its authors more frequently than other magazines. The magazine has a few regulars but it likes to shuffle the writers around each month. This can be good and it can result in articles that present new and different perspectives each month. But it also means that the magazine is a little uneven and can sometimes include articles that do not communicate the way they should. I can recall reading several articles that left me scratching my head, wondering why the editor didn't make additional changes so that the articles were clearer.<br /><br />The departments in Wired cover a large percentage of the space in every issue and they exceed the total length of many other magazines' department sections. The departments (with the exception of one) occupy the first two- thirds of each issue. The monthly featured articles are found near the end of each issue. This layout is different from other magazines that mix the departments and monthly features together. With Wired, the departments and featured articles are kept separate.<br /><br />Overall, I like Wired as a whole and the political articles rank as my favorite part of each issue. The magazine jumps around from topic to topic and the authors change more frequently than other magazines; two facts that could make Wired a little too scattered for certain readers. Some of the articles are not the best written I have ever seen but Wired is still a good enough magazine to recommend. It keeps readers current on technology, politics, business, and entertainment with a reputation for being modern and hip.",[],B00005N7TL,B00005N7TL,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2006-11-15 19:53:22.000,5,False
4,Boating Adventures and Buying Advice,"Boating Life is a publication about boating adventure and recreation and it dedicates most of its pages to boating enjoyment, product reviews, equipment reviews, and general advice. In many ways, this magazine is like a buying guide for boats. Not only does it contain many pages of product reviews, it also includes many featured articles that focus on the specifics of different boats (speed capability, length, miles per gallon, etc.), making it a good choice for reading material for those who are in the market for a new boat.<br /><br />Besides acting as a selling agent, Boating Life is also a magazine about adventure and it is common to find articles about specific bodies of water and how best to enjoy them; tales of long adventures on large lakes; and popular events around the nation where the best views are often those from a small water- going vessel. These rank among my favorite articles in each issue because they are more personal in nature and they get your imagination running.<br /><br />One thing I like and respect about Boating Life is that, unlike many other boating magazines, it keeps things on a realistic level. That is, it doesn't devote the majority of its pages to boats that only the rich can afford to buy. It offers reviews and advice on a wide range of boats, from an inexpensive fishing boat designed for two to a large expensive yacht that can hold ten or more guests. I don't mind reading about these more expensive boats from time to time, but they are more fantasy than anything. With Boating Life, there are many pages of ordinary boats that anyone can afford.<br /><br />Boating Life is a nice magazine overall and it makes a good choice for people who are in the market for a new boat or for those who already own a boat and want some advice on how best to maintain them and how best to enjoy them. Boating Life offers good reviews and facts about specific boats and, along with the adventure articles, it makes a good choice of magazine for the boating enthusiast.",[],B00005NIPO,B00005NIPO,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2006-09-16 15:53:27.000,8,False
3,Bridging the Gap Between Hispanics and Americans,"Latina is a cultural magazine designed to appeal to the modern, trendy Hispanic woman who resides in the USA. This magazine features a mixture of entertainment, fashion, and practical advice on topics ranging from personal finance to family life and its primary audience is young woman, both married and single.<br /><br />This magazine is designed with the female consumer in mind but there are several departments and monthly features that offer more widespread appeal. Latina Life, for example, is a collection of articles in each issue that contains many relevant articles offering good reading that will appeal to a broad range of people. Here, the reader can find articles about money, health, fitness, travel, and other subjects that most anyone can relate. In addition to this, it is common to find articles that focus on specific Latina women (both celebrity and non- celebrity) who have overcome adversity. These are often the best articles in each magazine because they often present inspirational stories where a challenge or difficult circumstance was overcome. These articles offer good reading that can apply to anyone regardless of age or gender.<br /><br />Most of the remaining featured articles in Latina are geared in the direction of strictly feminine topics and I tend to skip over these when I read. These articles talk about things such as manicures, hair styling, clothing selection, and other things that are intended for the female market. But in spite of the limited appeal, there is one thing that men will like: The photos. These articles about women and their fashion options are usually accompanied by plenty of pictures of hot Latin babes making them worthy of a look or two.<br /><br />Advertisements are common in this magazine and one interesting fact is that part of the ads are written in Spanish. This is only true, however, of the ads- the articles themselves are all composed in English. This surprised me when I first read Latina because I always thought the magazine contained English and Spanish in equal or nearly equal quantities and that Spanish was used in some of the featured articles. This isn't true, and while Latina does try to bridge the gap between Hispanic and American differences it is obvious that Latina assumes its readers already know a good deal of English.<br /><br />Latina contains a large amount of reading material that has little or no relevance to men but it redeems itself by including a good deal of articles that can appeal to anyone. There is an emphasis on stories relating to Latin women who have achieved success and overcome barriers and these are usually Latina's best articles. The personal touch is nice and the reading is inspiring. But most of the magazine is geared toward women and for this reason most men will not rate Latina very highly. I'm going to rate this publication with a small recommendation nonetheless because I can see its value and I can understand how the female market would enjoy this magazine.",[],B00005V3E8,B00005V3E8,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2006-09-09 18:03:05.000,4,False
4,Enticing Photos and Great Articles,"Coastal Living is a professionally- made magazine with lots of enticing photographs, personal stories, and general advice on making the most out of life on the coast. The emphasis in Coastal Living is on waterfront property and the events and entertainment that often take place in cities with a large coastal area.<br /><br />Much of what you read in Coastal Living pertains to better- known waterfront areas in the United States. Such popular destinations as Boston, Miami, New York, Long Island, California, Cape Cod, South Padre Island, and other tourist- oriented places comprise a large portion of the featured articles in this magazine. Many of these places (like New York City) have very expensive waterfront property than can often be next to impossible to buy. But these areas also include lots of tourist activities, which is why they are so frequently highlighted in this magazine.<br /><br />Besides the well- known destinations, Coastal Living also includes a good number of featured articles on lesser- known places. Many of these lack the fast- pace and the extensive nightlife of the more popular destinations, but they also offer better deals on property and an opportunity to get away from the chaos of the larger cities. Such places as the Delaware coast, Michigan, Ohio's Lake Erie coast, and others are often very quaint and interesting. Also, they offer property that is far more reasonable in price and is often within the affordability range for many buyers.<br /><br />Much of the properties you see and read about in Coastal Living are quite expensive. But remember- the majority of the homes are on major coastlines, so you can't expect to find them for selling for a low cost. These are high- demand, low supply properties and they vary greatly in price, but they are all expensive. In a popular area, these homes can sell up to the tens of millions of dollars. But in less popular areas, you can sometimes find some bargain prices on waterfront property. For example, Coastal Living has highlighted many Great Lakes properties that are priced very close to the overall U.S. average. They are not as cheap as most areas of the inner cities, no. But they are priced within the reach of many families.<br /><br />The emphasis in Coastal Living seems to be on properties- both main residences and vacation properties that are adjacent to a major coastline. But there are other items promoted for sale besides property. And much of this other merchandise is also quite costly. In the ""Currents"" section, for example, it is common to find things like lawn furniture, cufflinks, fancy pitchers, and other things selling for many times the usual price. Most of it is intended for those who want a little bit more and are willing (and able) to pay the price.<br /><br />Coastal Living is a personal magazine. Most of the stories involve families and couples who enjoy the coast. They share with the reader such things as how they keep their homes protected from the sea, what they do for entertainment, how they like to decorate, and why living on the coast means so much to them. Photos of families and couples often grace the pages of these types of articles, giving them a friendly, domestic feel.<br /><br />Most of what you will find in Coastal Living relates to the United States coast. There is only an occasional article about other coastal areas, like those of Mexico, the Caribbean, and other places. True, you will sometimes find an article about Hawaii or Alaska. But for the most part, Coastal Living tries to keep its journalism concentrated on places that lie within close proximity to the majority of Americans.<br /><br />Overall, Coastal Living is a very good magazine for people who enjoy vacationing on the coast, finding entertainment on the coast and, of course, living on the coast. The photography and presentation are excellent and it's interesting to read about the big- city life on the coast as well as some of the more ""unknown"" destinations. It provides great reading and a useful reference for people who already live on the coast or who are interested in purchasing waterfront property.",[],B000EGCIW8,B000EGCIW8,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2006-07-24 19:59:29.000,41,False
2,"Lots of Photos and Ads, Little Content","Interview is definitely a different type of magazine for me- someone who usually reads business and travel mags- and it's not quite what I expected. With a title like ""Interview"" I read my first copy of this magazine anticipating pages and pages of nothing but interviews. It turns out that interviewing is the main focus of the magazine, but it's not the only one. There is substantial space given to fashion, movies, and other areas, too. Some of these columns are worth an occasional look, but they failed to grab my attention. The writers seem to play it safe, and that includes the interview section. They don't ask many daring or controversial questions. They keep it simple, asking questions about an entertainer's latest album or movie, without delving much into their personal lives.<br /><br />Interview has many general annoyances. My greatest complaint is the advertising and the arrangement of the contents. About half of the pages in each issue are covered with ads, with fashion, liquor, beer, and hair care items providing the bulk of the advertising revenue. The ads are everywhere, with the majority in the front pages of each issue. The table of contents is buried, and I find this very frustrating. The contents starts with the interviews for that specific issue on one page, then a few pages later, proceeds to the remainder of the contents, which is the regular monthly features. What's annoying is that you have to search for the table of contents. It varies from one issue to the next, falling somewhere in the first half.<br /><br />Interview also varies greatly in length. Some issues are as short as 80 pages while others are more than 200 pages long. The shorter issues use staples for binding while the longer issues are bound in a more professional way, minus any metal.<br /><br />This magazine centers on entertainers, fashion, music, and the like. You won't find any interviews with politicians, businessmen, etc. Interview sticks strictly to entertainers, and that includes the regular monthly columns. You won't find a column about the business side of the music industry or film industry. You will find only articles about the stars themselves.<br /><br />Interview's only saving grace is the photography. It would make a nice gift for those who enjoy fashion and who like looking at pages and pages of men and women modeling fancy clothing. But in many ways, the photos are overemphasized and there isn't enough substance to the magazine. The articles are very shallow with more eye candy than reading material.<br /><br />Overall, Interview is sloppy and cluttered with too many ads to make it worthwhile reading material. My subscription was free, and I'm thankful that it was. Besides a few nice photos for clothing, there isn't much to make this magazine worth the cost.",[],B00005N7NY,B00005N7NY,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2006-07-24 19:52:52.000,10,False
4,Clean Male Entertainment,"Cigar Aficionado is a surprising magazine that I have been enjoying now for the past six months. I rarely smoke cigars or any other form of tobacco so when I first heard about this magazine I was naturally skeptical. I wasn't expecting much because due to my limited experience with smoking and the fact that I have limited knowledge about cigars. I figured this magazine would make its way into my `magazine mound' in the corner of my living room- a place where I toss most of the dozens of periodicals I receive each month.<br /><br />But after paging through the first issue, my opinion of this magazine changed drastically. The reason?- Cigar Aficionado is not strictly a magazine about cigars, like I assumed it would be. It is actually an entertainment magazine that devotes the majority of its pages to a wide range of topics like sports, cars, travel, fashion, and other like subjects. In one issue, you can read about all sorts of varied topics with article titles like ""Best Ski Resorts"", ""Winning at Poker"", ""The New Face of Sports Management"", etc. This caught me completely by surprise and I'm sure I'm not the only reader out there who felt this way when he/she read this magazine for the first time. Its title leads one to conclude that it is strictly about cigars but that isn't the case at all.<br /><br />My favorite parts of this magazine are the travel and drink sections. I like to partake in an occasional beer and I love to travel so I naturally gravitate toward these two sections. But even in the areas where I wouldn't normally have much interest I have found myself attracted to the articles anyway, thanks to the quality writing and photography. One such feature that I find myself accidentally enjoying is ""Profile""- a two or three page monthly feature that casts the spotlight on a celebrity who enjoys puffing on a good cigar. The celebrity (who can be anyone in sports, television, movies, or music) will talk about his/her career and the smokes he/she enjoys the most.<br /><br />Even though this is a multi- faceted entertainment magazine, cigar lovers will enjoy the ratings and buying guide information found in each issue. The magazine's own panel of experts blind tests each of several dozen smokes in each issue and then assigns a rating from zero to one- hundred points. The cigars are then sorted by category in descending order based on score, complete with tasting notes on each; the size; and the price. At the end of the ratings, you will find the same list organized by country of origin followed by another rating list called ""Connoisseur's Corner"" that includes more ratings of unique smokes. The only thing that could make this section better is more buying information. There is no web site, phone number, or other contact information provided. All you have is the name of the cigar and the price. It's up to you to find the cigar if you want to make a purchase.<br /><br />This magazine's subtitle is ""The Good Life Magazine for Men"". As such, there are only a few articles to be found that will interest the majority of women. Even the interviews (and the profile section) are usually written about men and from a man's point of view. About the only thing missing from this magazine is sex. That's right- you will find all sorts of things that are of interest to men in this magazine except for the most important one of all. I guess the editors of Cigar Aficionado decided that there are already enough magazines that cater to man's natural animal instincts and they concluded that devoting the space in each issue to other indulgences was sufficient.<br /><br />Overall, Cigar Aficionado is a very good magazine about entertainment. It costs more than other magazines but it is also much longer than most, with some issues approaching 350 pages. It offers a wide range of articles about living the good life, with excellent photography and entertaining writing that will appeal to the majority of men in all age groups.",[],B00005N7UC,B00005N7UC,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2006-06-21 04:19:44.000,7,False
3,Give Me the Details,"Details is a mildly interesting magazine that is geared toward men of various ages and lifestyles. The main group that Details aims to capture is the 17 to 35 year- old male but there are articles in each magazine that could be appealing to men of many different ages, mostly in the middle to upper income groups.<br /><br />Some things about Details quickly set it apart from other magazines. One difference is the ""departments"". Most magazines have departments, but instead of talking about the same things each month, these departments vary in their content (the only exceptions being ""Know- Tell"" and the ""The Details""). Each one contains similar stories from one month to the next, but with different subtitles, helping to make each issue a little fresher than it would otherwise be.<br /><br />As far as the writing goes, Details offers a great deal of diversity for a magazine. Yes, it is generally focused on things of interest to men, but it covers a very broad range of interests. You can find articles in this magazine on such diverse topics as the death penalty, raising kids, buying a new coat, setting up an internet business, breaking up with a girlfriend, or purchasing the best vodka. There are articles geared toward single men and married men, as well as younger men and middle- aged men.<br /><br />I like some of the articles found here but there is one problem I have with the writing in Details. It is common to find eye- catching headlines on the cover of Details that tempt you to find out more. This is nothing new and most every magazine does this. But the problem is that many of these eye- popping stories fail to keep you amazed when you read them. Take for example an article in a recent issue. On the front, it reads ""Is Your Wife a Bad Mom""? It sound like an engaging, intellectual read. But once you find the article and take in its 1,000+ words, you quickly discover that there is little or no substance. Basically, it simply tells men that accusing your wife of being a bad mom is a risky undertaking that could hurt her feelings. That is it. There is no intellectual analysis or quotes from studies; only the bottom line conclusion that mothers generally don't like to be called incompetent by their husbands. Other headlining articles in this magazine lead to similar disappointment.<br /><br />The writing in this magazine is on the edge and very blunt. It is common to find several four- letter words in many of the articles and while this doesn't bother me at all, I know that some readers will consider it too raw, too edgy, and too explicit. Details writers have no problem telling it like it is, and this can be both good and bad depending on one's perspective.<br /><br />Besides the language, some parts of this magazine could offend certain readers; namely the ""Anthropology"" page at the end. This closing ""article"" is meant to be humorous, but some readers will not see it that way. I don't know if it has always been this way, but what ""Anthropology"" does is show a person or multiple people and then asks the question ""Gay or ______"". For example, I have seen titles like ""Gay or Best Friends?"", ""Gay or Cowboy?"", ""Gay or Neo Punk Rocker?"", and others. With each of these, there is a diagram of sorts with arrows pointing to different clothing and bodily features and short comments about each one. Basically, it is asking you to think about these different attributes of the person or people in the picture and then decide if the way they dress, look, and act makes them gay. I find this silly and immature, but I can see how some readers would find it insulting. I don't know if Details has always done this or if the Anthropology page has been different in the past. But this is how it has been in every issue I have read and it needs to be changed.<br /><br />Advertisements claim about sixty percent of the pages in each issue of this magazine. They cover products like liquor, cars, electronics, cigarettes, fragrance, etc. Even though this magazine covers lots of different things, the item most often featured in the advertisements is clothing. The magazine seems to have a penchant for high fashion and it devotes more pages to expensive clothing than anything else. And each issue often has its own unique smell, thanks to all of the cologne samples. You can flip through the pages and find several samples in each issue, with many of the latest and trendiest scents from the biggest names in cologne.<br /><br />Overall, I am torn between liking or not liking Details Magazine. I like some of the articles on food, drink, politics and the like. But I don't necessarily like the shallow fluff that is often substituted for an intellectual discussion and I can understand how some readers would find certain aspects of this magazine insulting. This magazine is deserving of only about two and one- half stars which I will round up to three stars and give a small recommendation. Some will like this magazine and some will not. It's all a matter of what you like to read about and whether or not you can handle a magazine that pushes the envelope.",[],B00005N7PS,B00005N7PS,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2006-03-16 05:04:31.000,94,False
4,Sunset Fills You With Visions of the Western U.S.,"Sunset is a magazine dedicated to the people, culture, and lifestyle of the American west. This magazine divides its space among many different topics, such as food and entertainment, travel, recreation, gardening and more.<br /><br />I have been reading this magazine for about six months now and there are several things about it that make it worthwhile. The thing that stands out the most are the photographs, and I'm not talking about just the stunning scenery one normally associates with the West (like the National Parks or the coastline). Even the ordinary pictures are striking. In the Gardening section, for example, it is common to find pictures of family homes that have beautifully landscaped yards full of blossoming flowers and colorful plants. In the Home & Design section, one can find nice photographs of home interiors, showing different designs and furniture.<br /><br />One of the most unique qualities of Sunset is the fact that it is published in five different editions. There is a specially designed issue for the Northwest (Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska, and British Columbia), Northern California (Northern California and the majority of Nevada), Southern California (Southern California and Hawaii), The Southwest (Arizona, New Mexico, and the Las Vegas area of Nevada), and Rocky Mountain (Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah). This is a nice idea and it's one that other magazines should consider emulating. Based on where you live or where you have an active interest, this will be the region that your issue spends its pages covering. My subscription is for the Northern California region, so I am treated each month to articles about places like San Francisco, Sacramento, Reno (Nevada), Lake Tahoe, etc.<br /><br />One of the specialties of this magazine is food and it is common to find recipes throughout every issue. There is a special section set aside for food, but one can expect to find food articles and recipes everywhere as they read. Even the cover page of each issue features a food dish. And as you might guess, the featured recipes are generally those types of cuisine normally associated with each specific region of the west, with plenty of generic recipes thrown in to make sure everyone has something to cook.<br /><br />One of the specialty sections of this magazine that I like is the ""Value Vacation""- a subsection of Travel & Recreation. This section highlights a specific place to travel and then offers a day by day breakdown of things to do and places to see, with the cost for each itemized so you know exactly what to expect. The highlighted city or tourist area can be anyplace in the west and isn't limited to the region that your issue covers. This section is nice because it lets you see in black & white what it will cost for a few days of budget entertainment. It reminds me of some of the television programs shown on the Travel Channel.<br /><br />Advertisements cover about 40 to 50 percent of the pages of each issue and they are often found in bunches in the front and back and on alternating pages for much of the rest of each issue (typical for most magazines). The ads can center on all sorts of different things. Because this is a combination travel/culture/food/entertainment/home & garden/living magazine, the ads cover a wide range of products and services, from laundry detergent to credit cards to cat food.<br /><br />Overall, Sunset has proven itself an enjoyable magazine. I don't live in the western United States but this region is my favorite part of the country, so it makes sense that I would find something of value in this publication. I like the photography, the personal stories, the gardening and decorating ideas, and most other aspects of this magazine. If you're dead set in your ways and refuse to read about anything that deviates from your Eastern, Southern, or Midwestern lifestyle, then you may not like Sunset. But for the majority of people, Sunset has much to offer with pages and pages of eye- catching pictures and friendly articles about life in the American West.",[],B00005NIOW,B00005NIOW,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2006-01-23 01:34:33.000,25,False
4,"Wine Reviews, News, and More","Wine Spectator is a good wine magazine that seeks to keep the reader informed about new wine products, wine facts and education, and wine events. This magazine is published 17 times per year, so it is available often enough that most wine lovers will have more than their fill of reading material.<br /><br />Most of the material in Wine Spectator deals with buying wine, and you can expect to find several rating lists in every issue. The editors of the magazine supply the majority of the wine ratings, so when you read that one wine earned 95 points and another only 80, you need to keep in mind that these ratings are from the perspective of people who have sampled hundreds or even thousands of different wines. And with each rating or analysis, there is often contact information, such as the name of the winery or web page, so that you can learn more and/or inquire on making a purchase.<br /><br />To help shoppers find the wines in each issue, Wine Spectator includes a detachable card that includes the names of the different featured wines. This is a handy addition, because it eliminates the need to copy down names of wine on paper or attempt to memorize the titles. All you do is check off the wines you like on the card and take it with you to your favorite beverage store for easy reference.<br /><br />Wine Spectator seems to have an obsession with lists and with outlandish proclamations. It is common to find lists like ""World's 100 Greatest Pinot"" or ""The 50 Finest California Reds"". Consumers are attracted to listings, and that is probably why the magazine gave in and made lists a regular part of most issues. And it is common to find extreme statements like ""This is the best Cabernet Sauvignon on the Planet"" or ""Greatest German White Wine Ever"". The publication does this to attract attention and sell more issues, but it could get annoying to some readers.<br /><br />In spite of these few annoyances, Wine Spectator is still a good magazine. The writers at Wine Spectator are very good, very convincing, and very persuasive. They really know wine, and it comes through in their articles and recommendations. The editors articulate themselves very well and they know just the right way to describe the different brands and styles. It all adds up to a very informative magazine publication on the world of wine.",[],B00006GXD4,B00006GXD4,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2005-12-22 00:00:27.000,7,False
4,Bridal Guide Helps Make Your Wedding Day Complete,"Bridal Guide is a lengthy magazine designed to appeal to brides in waiting and to those women who see marriage on the horizon. This magazine is devoted to bridal fashion and to other things that are involved in making the day special and memorable. Besides the fashion, one can read about wedding planning, honeymoon ideas, photography, and other wedding- related things.<br /><br />When you read a copy of Bridal Guide, what stands out more than anything are the photos. This is the main reason people read this magazine in the first place: To look at wedding attire and compare different styles. Models wearing wedding gowns are abundant in this publication and some of the bridal gowns they adorn are quite stunning. To help future brides make a possible purchase, it is common to find a phone number and/or a web site with the majority of the photos. Bridal attire is the main focus of this magazine, but there are also some pictures of grooms and of other wedding party members, with models displaying other fashions for sale, once again complete with phone number and web page.<br /><br />The part of this magazine that focuses its attention on honeymoons and travel is probably my favorite part of the issue. What I like is the fact that this is one part of the magazine that can appeal/apply to anyone, regardless of marital status. These honeymoon tips and destination information provide some good reading material for the bride to be or anyone else who happens to read the magazine.<br /><br />Bridal Guide is a very lengthy publication, with each issue containing around 500 pages! This is more than double the length of most other magazines and it can make the issue seem a little overwhelming at times. Also, this magazine is saturated with ads. Since the majority of the gown- clad models are, in effect, advertisements for a specific fashion brand, one can expect to find ads covering the vast majority of this magazine's pages. This could be annoying to some, but one must bear in mind that the magazine's focus is wedding planning, so excessive advertising is expected.<br /><br />For young brides- to- be or bridal wannabes, this is a handy magazine to have around. It's very long, but it contains lots of fashion and wedding planning ideas to make the big day one to remember forever.",[],B00005NIRS,B00005NIRS,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2005-11-08 18:58:59.000,21,False
4,The Many Challenges of Business Ownership,"Entrepreneur magazine is one of my favorite business publications and it's the type of magazine I can count on for up- to- date information on business startups and for possible resolutions of common problems to the small business owner. A monthly publication, this magazine is designed to appeal to those who are presently owners of a small enterprise or who aspire to open their own business in the near future.<br /><br />What I enjoy most about this magazine are its personal articles- stories about ordinary people like you and me who have successfully started a new business venture. These people share their success stories with the reader, offering insight on what strategies helped them reach their present level of success and what challenges they still face. The people featured in the articles are more down to earth types who own smaller companies, making the magazine more realistic and something I and others can better relate to. Many other business magazines spend too much time interviewing billionaire CEO's and others who, while they may have some interesting stories to share, live lifestyles and have problems that only someone of their stature can relate.<br /><br />On the practical side, Entrepreneur contains many timely articles about common issues/problems/challenges that arise when you own your own company. Money, marketing, management, and other key topics are covered in each issue, with a regular department for these critical aspects of business ownership. In these sections, you can learn about tax law changes, legal issues with benefits, and other related topics.<br /><br />Entrepreneur organizes each issue quite nicely, with colored tabs on the pages that indicate which section (money, technology, marketing, etc.) they pertain to. This makes it that much easier to sift through, to find the information you need. And there is a section titled ""Sources"" that helps to index the different services and companies mentioned in each issue.<br /><br />Overall, this is a useful, practical magazine that can come in very handy for present business owners and for those who have an interest in proprietorship. It keeps business owners up to date with the latest changes in laws and it offers some creative solutions to the everyday problems that small businesses encounter each day.",[],B00005NINU,B00005NINU,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2005-10-01 14:57:26.000,10,False
4,Living in and Learning About America's Island State,"Hawaii Magazine is a very good publication for those who have an interest in America's fiftieth state. This magazine brings the world of the Hawaiian Islands to your home every month, with facts, figures, and photos taken from this island chain paradise.<br /><br />One thing about Hawaii Magazine that is different from what you might expect is that it covers more than just travel. When I read this publication for the first time, I was surprised at the contents within. I always assumed this was a magazine solely about travel and tourism. While travel, resorts, and related topics are an important part of this magazine, they are not the only part. The rest of Hawaii Magazine deals with cultural and native topics. It lets you discover the people who inhabit these islands. You get to learn about Hawaiian customs, holidays, art, dress, and culture.<br /><br />With the emphasis on culture, Hawaii Magazine is a learning experience. The people responsible for the publication of this magazine want readers to come away with a better understanding of what it means to be Hawaiian and to live in this island chain. They want you to think of Hawaii as more than just a nice, warm, sunny place to visit. They want you to learn about the people that inhabit Hawaii: How they dress, how they celebrate events, how they interact with others, etc.<br /><br />If I had to name a few cons to this magazine, they would have to be the publications short length (less than 100 pages per issue) and its infrequent publication (every two months). Other than these negative aspects, most everything else about this magazine makes it worthwhile to read. It's an educational lesson on the people and the lifestyle of those we call Hawaiian.",[],B00005NIO2,B00005NIO2,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2005-09-27 20:18:11.000,9,False
4,Living and Thriving in a House Made With Logs,"Log Home Living is a good magazine for those who have an active interest in buying and living in a home made from logs. This publication covers everything you need to know about this type of living, from the planning of a home all the way through the financing, the furnishing, and the maintenance.<br /><br />What I enjoy most about this magazine is the fine photographs found on most every page. I don't really have much interest in living in this type of home, but the photos are very appealing and enticing. Some of them are taken inside of log homes, letting you see firsthand the dividends that some attention to design can bring. Some of them are taken on the exterior, allowing readers to see the country landscape and marvel in the natural beauty.<br /><br />Another nice feature of this magazine is the abundance of phone numbers and web sites for goods and services. If you find something you like, you will know exactly where to turn for more information. If you find a product or service you like that doesn't list a source, don't worry- there are some special index sections in the back with lists of products from the current issue, referenced by page number, showing the company name, phone, and web site so you can find what you like and make a purchase.<br /><br />On the negative side, a magazine like this one contains LOTS of advertisements. The majority of them are found at the end of the magazine, but there are plenty of them throughout and you cannot turn more than a few pages before finding one. I would estimate that more than two- thirds of the pages have some sort of advertisement.<br /><br />Since a good deal of this magazine is dedicated to furnishing, interior design, landscaping, and maintenance, there is something here to suit every home owner's needs. Even if you don't have an interest in log homes, you can still find plenty to enjoy in Log Home Living. The pictures alone make it worth a look.",[],B00005N7VN,B00005N7VN,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2005-07-28 19:14:51.000,2,False
3,Attention Female Shoppers,"This magazine is a product of CondeNet publishing and it is aimed at the younger female market, roughly from ages 18 to 30. This publication is a shopper's paradise, with more advertising than most any other magazine on the market.<br /><br />I got a complimentary subscription to this magazine one day and I accepted, not only because it was free, but also because I really didn't know it was a woman's fashion magazine. With a title like ""Lucky"", there were all sorts of possibilities. It could have been about gambling, sweepstakes, or about getting lucky. I didn't know it was a woman's magazine, so I accepted it. And from what I can see, this magazine is one of average worth to the average person and it will appeal mostly to younger women.<br /><br />Fashion covers a good amount of the magazine's 200 plus pages. Beauty tips are another important area of coverage. It is also common to see samples of different products inside the pages of each issue. Things like perfume samples, shampoo, and other things can be found buried somewhere within each copy. The coverage includes casual as well as high- class clothing and beauty products, with most of it falling at the upper end of the cost scale.<br /><br />If you can tolerate the clogging of advertisements, this magazine might be a good choice for the younger female crowd that likes to keep in- tune with the latest styles and trends. Outside of that targeted market, however, I don't see much use for Lucky magazine. The photography is very good and the presentation is professional, but the magazine will likely be rated average by a large cross- section of the population.",[],B00005NIRG,B00005NIRG,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2005-01-28 15:10:02.000,11,False
3,"Good Eats, Fine Drinks, and Having Fun","Food and Wine is a pretty good magazine for those who enjoy the finer things in life when it comes to unusual cuisine and expensive fermented beverages. This publication is usually very long- over 250 pages- and its packed full of recipes, travel excursions to wine growing regions, and general facts about different varieties of wine and where to find them.<br /><br />One thing about this magazine that surprised me at first is the emphasis on the food. I know the magazine is titled ""Food and Wine"", but my initial impression was that this would be a magazine devoted entirely to wine with occasional mention of the foods that go with wine. It isn't like that at all. The food sections and the recipes are just as important as the featured wines. Recipes are so frequent, in fact, that the magazine even has an index located near the front with all the recipes listed by food type, showing the page number to turn to for the recipe.<br /><br />Besides the frequent talk about food and wine, this magazine is also dedicated to entertaining. I have heard it suggested that this magazine should change its name to ""Food, Wine, and Entertainment"". It would make sense, because conviviality and high- class partying are certainly an important component of this magazine.<br /><br />There is one thing about Food and Wine that I wish was different. I appreciate the factual information and I like the personal touch that you find in some of the stories about winery owners, chefs, and the like. But I think Food and Wine gets a little too sidetracked from time to time in its reporting. For example, it is common to find stories that talk about subjects like home decorating. This would be fine in a magazine about home design, but I don't think it belongs in a magazine like this.<br /><br />Overall, this is still a good publication. Lovers of great eats and fine drinks will enjoy it the most. It's worth taking a look, if nothing else, just for the recipes. Even if you're not a frequent imbiber of the fruit of the vine, there is still something of interest to be found in the pages of this magazine.",[],B00005NINY,B00005NINY,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2005-01-18 17:21:08.000,50,False
4,Technology and Public Policy,"Technology magazines are often a little bit on the boring side due to their limited appeal that makes them readable only to those who work in or have an avid interest in this field. IEEE Spectrum, however, is a little bit different. It has plenty of information on the latest advancements in technology, like other tech publications, but from a different ""spectrum"", if you will.<br /><br />What sets this magazine apart from the rest is the personal and political topics that make their way into each issue. You can read about topics like global warming, tariffs, technology regulations, and general business ethics. These different topics are blended together with the magazine's core subject of technology and the result is a publication that is more readable than most in the tech field.<br /><br />Another nice thing about Spectrum is the minimal amount of advertising. What few ads you will see are entirely related in some way to technology. You won't see an ad for a car, boat, home financing, or other product or service like you do in most every other magazine in America. This magazine sticks with technology for its ads and because of this, the few ads that exist seem even less common than they already are.<br /><br />This magazine is a little shorter than other monthly publications, with each issue containing about 50 to 80 pages. This is the length I expect in a weekly magazine- not a monthly one. The publishers need to improve and expand the number of pages. A magazine this short doesn't provide enough reading material for an entire month.<br /><br />Still, IEEE Spectrum is a good technology magazine. The combination of political, economic, and social topics keeps this publication from getting too dry and too technical. It makes it much easier to read than other magazines of the same genre.",[],B0000C4CU9,B0000C4CU9,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2004-12-23 17:51:54.000,9,False
5,Golf's Best Magazine Publication,"Golfers share many things in common and one of these is an often fanatical love for the game. For these types, nothing can take the place of heading to the nearest golf course, but Golf Digest comes very close. This magazine contains over 200 pages each month, dedicated exclusively to the sport of golf.<br /><br />The things that set Golf Digest apart from the competition are the numerous articles about learning and improving your game and the personal stories and interviews. Other golfing publications attempt to help you learn, but they often get too mechanical. Golf Digest shows you how to improve your game with tips from professionals, including some of the star- studded members of the golfing elite like Tiger Woods.<br /><br />Besides all the tips and tricks, Golf Digest also shows the personal side of the sport with interviews and more intimate stories about the many colorful personalities in the game. This personal dimension adds greatly to the magazine's overall appeal, providing great reading material to complement the more instructional side of the magazine.<br /><br />Golfing Digest may not be as great as a day spent on your favorite golf course, but it comes close. I consider it the best publication of its kind and I recommend it to anyone with an interest in the game.",[],B00005N7QD,B00005N7QD,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2004-12-18 04:15:20.000,8,False
5,We were Sailing Along,"Are you the type who enjoys a nice excursion in a sailboat? If so, then you will probably enjoy Sail magazine. This publication is one of dozens available on the newsstands that cover the sport and hobby of sailing, but I feel its one of the best around.<br /><br />What makes me feel so strongly about this magazine is the fact that the articles and advice are written by actual sailors. This magazine doesn't waste the reader's time with articles composed by so- called professional writers. Instead, it sticks with the people who know sailing better than anyone: the sailors themselves. This makes the magazine more believable and more respectable.<br /><br />Sail divides its time between factual articles and ones that are more personable in nature. The factual articles cover things like how to maneuver a boat in different directions; what to look for when you shop for a new navigation device; the advantages and disadvantages of catamarans; etc. These factual stories are intended more for those who own boats and want to keep them in tip- top condition. The other articles deal with personal stories, and they rank among my favorites in each issue. These articles feature individuals and families who share their sea- going experiences with you.<br /><br />Sail also has lots of reviews of boat- related products and plenty of ads in the back of each issue for shoppers who are looking for a boat. Ads in the rest of the magazine are scattered around, but they tend to stick mostly to boating and related products. The reviews are nice, but I would prefer to see more opinions from more people, to make comparisons.<br /><br />Sail magazine has many great qualities, and they add up to a well- rounded publication- a magazine that I feel is the best in its field. Whether you sail for sport or for leisure, Sail magazine is probably the best of its kind. Great photography, informative articles, and personal stories place this magazine in a league of its own.",[],B00005N7SK,B00005N7SK,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2004-11-11 20:16:41.000,8,False
5,Learn about the World and its many Wonders,"National Geographic is one of the best magazines of its kind, with plenty of great photography, thoughtful articles, and diverse coverage of several different topics relating to the planet earth. Stories about wildlife, different cultures, and even environmentalism and the politics it breeds can be found on the pages within each issue.<br /><br />What makes this magazine so enjoyable is the fact that it goes so in- depth in its coverage and includes stories with a personal element. When most people think about National Geographic, they usually think about the great photographs of natural wonders, exotic plants, and animal wildlife. These things are all great, but they form only part of the magazine's overall appeal. Stories about different cultures and peoples from around the world are just as good, and are usually presented in a personal way. You feel like you know the people on an intimate level when you read this magazine.<br /><br />This publication contains between 120 and 160 pages in most issues, with about a dozen or so monthly departments, as well as some varied articles that change each month, but are always concentrated on nature, science, politics, culture, etc.<br /><br />National Geographic is often very educational and intellectual, making it a learning device as well as a magazine for entertainment. It's one of the better, more thorough magazines on the market. Go ahead and give it a try. You just might learn something in the process.",[],B00005NIOH,B00005NIOH,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2004-10-28 21:18:52.000,2,False
3,It's What Men Like to Read,"Men's Journal is a decent magazine full of varied topics of interest to men. This magazine covers areas like sports, adventure travel, fashion and style, cars and trucks, career issues, etc. This publication directs all of its articles toward men, with an emphasis on what is most appealing to males throughout a typical week in their lives.<br /><br />One thing about Men's Journal that is a little different from other men's magazines is that it doesn't flaunt women to sell its issues. In fact, there are practically no pictures of women at all in this publication- something that will be considered an asset to some, and a liability to others. This magazine refuses to play the female card and instead focuses its articles on topics that men like to read about.<br /><br />Men's Journal is often obsessed with lists, and I think this is especially true in the last few years. Take a look at the cover of most issues and you will see a large, boldface advertisement for some sort of list. In one issue, it might be a ranking of the best cities for entry level jobs. In another issue, it might be a listing of the best places for young entrepreneurs. Whatever it might be, Men's Journal seems to have an infatuation with lists, probably because men like lists and it helps increase sales.<br /><br />This magazine can be counted on to produce some fairly good reading, but I must warn that many of the articles are a little too simplistic, with little emphasis on intellectualism. Even the articles about politics and business are often riddled with obvious statements that most anyone would know. But overall, I still think Men's Journal is a good magazine. It is varied enough that most anyone will find something interesting to read and the price is very low.",[],B00005NIOC,B00005NIOC,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2004-10-22 02:58:04.000,142,False
3,Home Economics 101,"Family Circle is a fairly good magazine that features articles on family life, raising kids, travel, personal finance, home improvements, and more. It is primarily directed at the female population, with articles that emphasize the roles that mother's play in household management.<br />The articles that feature recipes and family life form the bulk of the stories in Family Circle. Less common are the articles involving personal finance and other topics. These financial articles are a nice addition, and I was surprised when I first saw them in this magazine. But potential readers should be forewarned that these articles are not very in- depth. They only skim the surface of finance, talking about such simple matters as balancing a checkbook, refinancing a home, and paying off credit card debt. You aren't going to find a story about purchasing stock options or selecting tech stocks. Family Circle keeps it simple and covers only those financial topics that are relevant to taking care of the home and daily living.<br />Family Circle is published 15 times per year, with a low subscription cost. It may not cover topics as thoroughly as other, more specific magazines and it can sometimes get a little repetitive from month to month. But it's a pretty good magazine overall, with tips on cooking, cleaning, fashion, raising kids, and taking care of one's home.",[],B00005NIN0,B00005NIN0,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2004-04-08 18:40:24.000,27,False
4,Informative Info on Social and Physical Sciences,"Scientific American is a good magazine for those who enjoy reading about modern science, advancement in technology and medicine, economic improvements, and anything else of a scientific nature. Each issue is about 130 pages in length and can be counted on to stimulate your intellectual curiosity.<br />One thing that makes Scientific American more appealing than other science magazines is the fact that it includes articles on more than just the physical sciences, like physics, chemistry, geology, etc. It also contains timely and informative articles on social sciences, like economics and politics. This adds a lot to the magazine's appeal, and it's one of the main reasons why I choose to read it each month.<br />One thing that might bother some potential readers of this magazine is that Scientific American does tend to present a mostly pro- government angle on the social and human interest stories that it presents. In almost every instance, the writers of Scientific American draw the immediate conclusion that only the government can possibly solve the pressing issues of the day. They don't even give much consideration to anything else. They immediately concede most any problem to the authority of the state.<br />In spite of the ""liberal"" leanings, however, I feel that Scientific American is still a very good publication to read. It includes puzzles that test your knowledge of science, book reviews on recent scientific book releases, and some good, well- written articles about science and how it relates to our day- to- day life. It's a good magazine for those who like to stay informed.",[],B00008DP07,B00008DP07,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2004-04-05 15:12:29.000,71,False
2,I Wish I was Thirteen Again,"Stuff is a sister publication to Maxim magazine. It is similar to Maxim in several ways. Both feature a significant share of silly articles and questionable writing abilities by the journalists who contribute to each issue. And, of course, both focus on women and sex to help them sell.<br />With Stuff, the reader is treated to approximately 150 pages of mindless drivel, with goofy monthly departments like ""A Guy and His Stuff"", which features a male celebrity who describes some of his favorite possessions, and the ""Back page Activity Sheet"", which features a puzzle of some sort, like a word search or maze. As you can see from these two examples, Stuff is not exactly an intellectually stimulating magazine. It is aimed at a young male crowd- even younger than the target market of Maxim.<br />Most guys who purchase Stuff do so for the photos of near- naked women. These photos can be found throughout the magazine, from the cover and on through to the end. The interviews with some of these celebrities are about as useless as they could possibly be, with most of the conversation in the interviews geared toward personal relationships and feelings about any number of shallow topics.<br />If you like to reminisce about your days in junior high school, the Stuff might be a good choice of magazines for you. But if you prefer at least an inkling of intelligence, then I recommend passing on Stuff. There isn't much substance here at all, and most of what you read will leave you shaking your head and rolling your eyes. The magazine's primary audience is the 16 to 22 age group and even many in the target group will find it idiotic. For everyone else, Stuff is a total waste of time. Almost no brainpower is dedicated to the writing of this magazine.",[],B00005NIR1,B00005NIR1,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2004-04-05 15:11:20.000,44,False
3,Maximum Female Fun for Young Men,"Maxim is a monthly publication aimed at the younger male population, aged 16 to 30. This magazine offers a few amusing tidbits each month, like jokes and unusual ways to make things. There is an occasional fashion article, and some monthly articles on electronic gadgets and music. But the primary reason why people buy Maxim and the main reason it sells as well as it does is the women.<br />Maxim is not really an adult magazine, like Playboy or Penthouse. Its photographs do not expose so much that they should garner an X rating. But many of them come very close. From the picture on the cover (always a young woman, often with a seductive look in her eyes and much flesh exposed) to the photos in the middle, Maxim uses sex to sell. It isn't strictly a photo- op magazine for young women. There are interviews to accompany the visual effects. But the small talk is almost always geared toward sex- how to get it, how to keep getting it for a long time, how to improve your chances to get it, how to help friends get it, how to turn women on, etc.<br />The photos in Maxim are enticing, and I don't think any red- blooded American male would deny this fact. But what hurts Maxim a little bit and what keeps it from gaining as much respect as it could have is the monthly dose of stupidity that comes with each issue. Much of what you find in the ""How to"" section, for example, is idiotic and I cannot imagine anyone taking it seriously. The ""Bar Exam"" feature is also bordering on stupidity, with a set of trivia questions each month about some type of useless information.<br />Overall, I think Maxim is at least an average magazine, in spite of its flaws. Yes, many of the articles are brainless and the humor is the type that would amuse a 12- year old. But the main reason people buy and read (or should I say look) at Maxim is the photographs of the women. With so much flesh exposed, without going to far, Maxim is a publication with a purely visual bend. You won't find much intelligence here, but you will find plenty of photos of scantily clad women, tempting your hormones with their youthful good looks and uninhibited personalities.",[],B00005NIPP,B00005NIPP,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2004-04-05 12:52:38.000,12,False
5,Flawless Publication for Lovers of the Great Outdoors,"Backpacker is an outstanding magazine for those who love to hike and also for those who enjoy paging through a magazine containing lots of enticing photographs of nature scenes. This magazine is, first and foremost, a publication for lovers of the outdoors and the sport of backpacking. But the pictures of mountains, lakes, streams, wildlife, etc., are enticing to anyone. They can quickly convert the non- outdoorsman type into a nature lover.<br />Besides the great pictures, Backpacker is also excellent for its product testing and for its advice and educational material. Backpacks, mountain bikes, tents, and so forth might seem like simple products, but you would be surprised at how many different varieties and options are available for this type of merchandise. Backpacker describes different items available for sale, complete with web site address and phone# so you can make a purchase, and it often conducts tests to see how the different products stack up. It also offers educational material on the sport of backpacking and general advice on such topics as food, exercise, proper nutrition, first aid, etc.<br />Backpacker averages between 90 and 120 pages in total length and it's published 9 times per year (three of the issues combine two months into one). It's one of the few special interest magazines I have read that has something to offer most anyone. Even if you don't like hiking, there is still a good chance you will enjoy thumbing through the pages of Backpacker, if nothing else, just to enjoy the great photography.<br />Overall, this is an outstanding outdoor publication. The articles, the personal stories, the advice, the photos, and the educational material all add up to a perfect magazine for anyone who loves to partake in outdoor activity or who just enjoys looking at the stunning photos. 5+ stars to Backpacker!",[],B00005NIN8,B00005NIN8,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2003-11-03 15:26:53.000,14,False
4,Enticing Photography,"Islands Magazine is a must for the travel lover. Each issue features stunning photography, articles from people who have visited various world islands, and advertisements on popular travel destinations around the globe.<br />The articles covered in this magazine usually focus on popular islands for travelers, like the Caribbean, South Pacific Islands, Hawaii, etc. But on occassion, the magazine features other islands, too, including those that are not as popular as tourist destinations like the Balearic Islands, Ceylon, Madagascar, and others.<br />There are LOTS of advertisements in this magazine, and that might not sit well with some readers who prefer more articles and less selling. But the ads are helpful to the reader because they often include bargain prices. There are also classified ads from other readers who have island vacation property to rent.<br />If you like to travel and you love water, then Islands magazine is a great publication to read. The photography alone makes it worth while. It will tempt you to head to the nearest travel agency and book your tropical beach vacation asap!",[],B00005N7R0,B00005N7R0,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,2003-05-08 14:59:39.000,41,False

Home Theater gives I feel good advice on what to buy, has interesting columns and so forth.  They'll occasionally cover rather esoteric high-end equipment, but they also cover things that are mid-priced.  And as these things go, they seem more honest in their coverage than most.  Stereophile, a competitor, might be a tad more technical, but the reviews there are harder to figure out, and some of the equipment so esoteric that only a millionaire would buy it (nothing wrong in covering that, sort of like a car magazine talking about Ferrari), and they get too lost sometimes on the ""golden ear"" aspects.

5,"After 14 years, he STILL wants to read this......","We first got this magazine when our son was 5 years old.  He could not read, so we would read it together, and it delighted him.  With lots to do from the object search (find the objects hidden in pictures), to the questions, quizzes, to the ""how-to-draw"" lesson featured in each issue, there was plenty to attract all ages of readers from K to , well, my son is now 19 and still reads it!<br />It all started with our youngest daughter becoming 5 this past winter.  Our 19 year old son found her pawing around in his hidden stash of NATURE FRIEND MAGAZINES which we had stopped getting over a decade ago.  He kept carrying on about how he wished we could get it again ""for her sake"".<br />I looked all over the internet, through every directory and in old editions of the magazine, but NATURE FRIEND seemed to have disappeared.<br />Then we found it here on AMAZON.COM a couple of months ago.  We got our first issue a few weeks ago and there is always someone reading it somewhere in the house- ME INCLUDED!<br />The quality of the magazine is greatly improved.  There is plenty to do for all ages, recipes, studies of interesting things (like where do dandelions come from and how did they get here and what do you do with them....) and interactive projects for all ages.<br />One of our favorite features is the HOW TO DRAW series that they still have.  Very nice lessons on drawing some kind of animal or natural thing are given.  Readers send in their best shot at it and many photos of their contributions are featured in future issues.  There is a lot packed in to this 25 page magazine- and NO ADS!<br />I can not rate this magazine highly enough.

1,Too religious,"I wanted to enjoy literary essays, stories, and articles, but it seems like every issue I received this last year is packed full of a religious agenda of one variety or another.  To be sure, the themes seem to be an eclectic variety of spiritual and cultural mysticism, but the magazine never just leaves it out.

Remember recent surveys show less than 17% of British folks attend church weekly, compared with over 50% of Americans. If they'd stay out of the religious stuff I'd give them 5 stars as the rest of the content is first-rate! I also take this same firm's other quarterly called Evergreen.

4,Roasted Banana Bars with Browned Butter Pecan Frosting,"I found a Cooking Light magazine from 2009 and tried their banana bars with browned butter pecan frosting. Can I say delicious (the bananas are roasted with brown sugar and butter first), but I think personally I'd about half the sugar. When they say light in this magazine they seem to mean reducing fat. So the recipe had 8.4g of fat but 35.1g of carbs . I think if they are going to say a recipe is healthier they should also reduce the sugar. So next time I'll remember how sweet the cake was and lower the amount of sugar to say 3/4 cup instead of 1 1/4 cup. Light to me at least seems to mean less fat AND sugar. I didn't play around with the recipe because I only had three bananas and couldn't afford to get it wrong on the first try. I'll try other recipes in this magazine if I find any in the future but I'll remember to pay attention to the sugar.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",[],B002PXVZW2,B002PXVZW2,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2017-02-10 00:38:09.000,0,False

It is definitely aimed at the age group of 20-50.<br /><br />If you like cooking you will also enjoy some of the recipes and articles on how to prepare food. The advertising in the magazine is also not very annoying. It seems like the products advertised suit the magazine. I especially liked the section on questions Dr. Oz answers. That was informative. I'm glad I don't drink raw milk after reading his comments. There is also information on the latest health scares and what to do about them.<br /><br />The issue I got also had recipes for spa products you can make at home.

This magazine has stories about hanging clothes on clotheslines and canning vegetables. Since I grew up overseas in Africa this magazine appeals to me since it talks about things from my childhood. I'm only 47 but it is like I lived 100 years ago. The advertisements in this magazine do seem geared for people in their 70s and beyond. What I love reading is the Wanted ads. A lot of people are looking for old friends or for items to make their lives more fun.

5,Very Interesting,When I picked up this Reader's Digest that we get in the mail I was instantly intrigued by the article about who Americans trust the most. Apparently we trust Tom Hanks the most and Sandra Bullock is next. If I have to admit it I've seem many of their movies and they are usually quite good. Which proves to me that when actors and actresses have good character it shows through in a movie and makes you respect them even more. Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts also made the list. Oprah came in at number 59 which I thought was a bit shocking. I'd imagined her being way at the top of the list. Jeff Bezos came in at number 78. I trust him a lot more than most of the people on the list.

Do the new stick-on manicures work? What is the newest information on cancer prevention?<br /><br />Dr. Andrew Weil has a 5-minute section with holistic-health advice where he explains why Wild Alaskan salmon and blueberries will keep skin youthful. Is the air in your home as clean as it could be?<br /><br />Fun product pages offer seasonal comforts. For summer you may find yourself looking up beach blankets and fans. Special sections show you how to lose weight, even when on vacation. Interesting advice on how to beat stress and why you should find ways to increase the release of oxytocin.<br /><br />The only thing in the magazine of concern seems to be the advice section which I read, but take some of her advice with a big pinch of salt. If someone thinks they are suffering from an addiction, they probably are. I'm at times rather surprised by her answers that seem to lean towards a casual approach to serious life-changing situations, although she seems to give women great advice about health issues when it comes to making them feel better about breast cancer or work situations.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",[],B00005N7U1,B00005N7U1,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2006-06-17 21:18:53.000,13,False

The recipe cards all have shopping lists on the back, so you can grab the cards and head to the grocery store. There is also a handy recipe index organized by categories at the end of the magazine.<br /><br />The Kids recipe section encourages young cooks to participate in family meals. This issue had a recipe for a delicious tuna salad with roasted red pepper and grape tomatoes. Just for Kids tips give ideas for how to juice a lemon and there are cute kid comments about the recipes.<br /><br />Everyday with Rachael Ray embraces life and does it with a realistic flair. In the June/July issue, ideas for picnics include shopping lists and recipes for Melon Skewers with Orange-Lime Marinade. Roy Yamaguchi cooks at home with his family and offers recipes like Miso Cod with Buttered Mushrooms.<br /><br />What I like most about this magazine is the realistic recipes complete with everyone cooking and enjoying life. The pictures are spontaneous and the series of pictures for the Ice Cream Cake are step-by-step heaven. Just when you think this magazine has everything you could wish for, an Everyday Menu Planner appears to give recipes and shopping lists. Grilled Shrimp with Cucumber Salad and Smoked Turkey Panini are must-have recipes for the summer. Peaches resting on a marshmallow meringue are perfect for dessert after the Baby Back Ribs with Jammy Glaze.<br /><br />This is a magazine about cooks, chefs and Rachael's recipes. The ""Ask Rachael"" section gives you a chance to send in e-mails to ask Rachael about her life or to have your foodie question answered in the magazine.

The recipe for Stuffed Tomatoes and Summer Squash had me wishing it was October again and the recipe for Fig Jam reminded me of my childhood in Africa where we had a Fig Tree in the backyard.<br /><br />Saveur is filled with nostalgia, entertaining food adventures and delicious recipes.

If you are creative, you are never afraid, because you can design yourself out of any situation."" ~Li Edelkoort<br /><br />If you are interested in items like the Nissan Actic Concept Car (that has a matching trailer) or you want to discover new modern options for your bathroom, kitchen or garden, this magazine delivers.<br /><br />DWELL has a variety of articles to interest the casual decorator or the seriously focused chef.

The library in the April/May issue is to die for! Big windows and shelves galore.<br /><br />Dwell is a magazine designed to inspire and inspire it did! Even some of the text is in color.

5,Home Cooking with Creative Flair,"Imagine making a Beehive Cake or a Honey-Citrus Iced Tea. When looking through this magazine you need a good cup of tea and a pair of scissors. You will be cutting out a lot of recipes! In fact, I'm sitting here cutting out recipes in between typing. There are 16 pages of recipes in a ""card"" format.<br /><br />The Favorite Meal section and Cooking for One or Two is always of interest. It shows you how to put an entire meal together and all the recipes are included.<br /><br />There is also a section where you can view enviable country kitchens. Then you can learn how to make ordinary foods extraordinary. Add curry powder to chicken salad or add brewed coffee to cookie dough.<br /><br />The ""Men Who Run the Range"" section is a series featuring men who love to cook and then you can also find out what people are eating in various states across the country. These are ideas and recipes from real cooks across America.<br /><br />One time I looked in the ""Does Anyone Have...?"" section and found a note about a woman who was looking for specific items. After sending her a small box, she then reciprocated and sent me the most beautiful framed pressed flowers. It is a fun section where you can read about recipes people are looking for and if you have the recipe, there is an address where you can mail the item. I recently learned how to make rosemary crackers and someone is looking for a recipe for various crackers.<br /><br />This magazine also has info on cooking schools all over the country. You could also be a Field Editor and share your recipes, cooking tips and other ideas with the home-office staff. You could literally end up in this magazine!<br /><br />Some of the delicious recipes I've been clipping from this magazine include:<br /><br />Grilled Sirloin Steak<br />Crispy Fried Chicken<br />Herbed Seafood Skewers<br />Chicken with Rosemary<br />Vegetable Cheese Tortellini<br />Grilled Turkey Burgers<br />Beehive Cake<br />Honey Citrus Iced Tea<br /><br />Tonight I made a chicken dish with homemade stuffing and a mushroom gravy that my husband really loved. I think this magazine inspires me to cook more and I have never read this magazine without tearing out pages galore. Now I'm dreaming about the Pear Crisp with Lemon Sauce and the Raspberry Cheesecake Pie.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",[],B00006KYZ9,B00006KYZ9,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2005-04-20 07:46:01.000,13,False
5,Dreamy Articles about Spas and Cooking,"Well, in the November issue last year, this magazine had a spa getaway section. Now I know why so many people were in La Conner the last time I was there. There is a top-secret spa hiding there. Who knew! I love La Conner and had no idea there was a day spa there.<br /><br />They also featured the ""Salish Lodge and Spa"" at which you might find me drinking tea with my parents on a lazy afternoon or having dinner when I'm feeling like splurging on a gourmet dinner. They have redecorated, however they still have a wonderful fireplace upstairs. I spent the first night of my honeymoon at the Salish Lodge and I can't wait to stay there again. They have deep baths and the entire experience of staying there is just luxurious. Anyway, this magazine tells you where to go and gives you ideas for luxurious getaways now and then. Oh and don't forget Rosario. When my aunt took us away for the weekend, we had our toes painted while sitting out in the sun.<br /><br />If you are thinking of visiting Seattle, this is a good magazine to keep handy so you can find out about treasures like the Elliot Bay Book Company or Pike Place Market. The Dining Guide will lad you to places you only thought appeared in dreams. If you are in Seattle, go to Palisade. There is an amazing view, gourmet food to die for and even a fish pond with a cute bridge you can walk over. We love this place for family parties. Ray's boathouse has an upstairs café we love and then there is the Metropolitan Grill where you will taste steaks that have been grilled over mesquite coals. If you want to go all out and enjoy a nine-course feast, try The HerbFarm that is now located in Woodinville. Chef Jerry Traunfeld also makes amazing Lavender cookies and the recipe is in his HerbFarm cookbook.<br /><br />This magazine inspires thoughts of staying at the Edgewater hotel and watching ferries sail by on lazy rainy days. You will always find intriguing features, talk about the town and a section on enjoying the good life of food and entertainment.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",[],B00006KWIC,B00006KWIC,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2004-01-29 07:45:34.000,8,False

5,Just Plain Good!,"Of all the magazines, this one has the best layout.<br /><br />Whether you are looking for the latest news on your favorite star or are looking for a new recipe...this magazine has it all.<br /><br />You know how many magazines say: ""Oh, we are going to tell you about...."" And five minutes later, you are still looking for ""that"" article. Well, in this magazine they have a great Contents page with a special: ""On the Cover"" section. So, if you want to read about Nicole Kidman she is on page 110! OK, that was in the November 2001 issue and it is quite a sad article. What ever happened to the fairy tale? I just don't know...<br /><br />Now, if you love reading about other people who are making the news, the People section always has something fun to read about. Fashion and beauty gives ideas on the latest nail color or makeup tips. The articles on relationships are interesting.<br /><br />This magazine also has sections for: Health & Well Being, Consumer Sense, The Better Way, Food & Home, Fiction, Departments and Columns. The TECH section is always of interest. There is a definite focus on women, as in: ""The Best Cell Phones for Women.""

Didn't you get my fax?""<br /><br />Something about the pictures in this magazine always remind me of a bright sunny day. The open kitchens and lush gardens are just a treat to see.<br /><br />The recipe section really has a personality all of its own.

5,In Memory of My Grandmother,"My Grandmother used to give me all her Sunset Magazines when she was done looking through them.

Like in the December 2001 issue, Peter Fish wrote an article about The voice of Christmas which is about Bing Crosby.<br /><br />In the middle of the magazine, you can find a postcard that says: Information worth sending for. They do all the work for you...you just have to circle the information number to receive information on everything from International Travel to products you see advertised. They never leave you wondering where to find a unique product as they have a ""Sources: Where to Find It"" section.<br /><br />The Holiday Section always has me dreaming! Who would not want to walk on the Multnomah Falls Trail in Oregon or stand on a log bridge over a river and just dream a day away. Sometimes I would just like to dissolve into some of the pictures. Especially the last issue, where they showed a cabin in the woods with Christmas Lights in Stehekin, Washington.<br /><br />If you live in Washington, this is a MUST HAVE!<br /><br />The January 2002 issue has an article on kayaks and a recipe for French Cream with Blueberry Pudding.<br /><br />Reading this magazine is really almost a family traditon!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",[],B00005NIOW,B00005NIOW,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,2001-12-30 09:57:09.000,50,False

When you think about it -- the vendors listing the advertising are paying for the magazine in a way and the price should be more attractive to bring in the people to buy their products.

She loved the magazines and when she grew out of them, she graduated to 'Cricket' which is the magazine that follows on from 'Ladybug'.Since 'Ladybug' contains lots of activities, stories and songs, it doesn't take long to build up a useful library of resources.

They offer free articles for every genre imaginable, editor blogs, writing competitions, forums, opportunities to join online critique groups and receive peer reviews, and much more.<br /><br />One thing WD does not offer subscribers, however, is access to current and past issues on their website, unlike most other magazines do these days.

I have come to depend on TV Guide's reviews of existing and new TV shows--most especially its detailed information about the fall, spring and summer lineups of new shows--to help me choose what I will record on my DVR. I also enjoy the many interviews with TV stars that TV Guide offers each week.<br /><br />Always in the past when subscribing directly with TV Guide, I paid with a paper check and used snail mail--something I almost never do for anyone any more. Now I don't have to do it for TV Guide either! It is so wonderfully convenient to now subscribe through Amazon. After you order your subscription, Amazon communicates with TV Guide to let them know if you have an existing subscription, which I do. Your new subscription is tacked onto the end of your existing subscription through TV Guide.<br /><br />When ordering my subscription here on Amazon, I was careful to supply a shipping address with my name and street address exactly as they appear on my TV Guide mailing label. For good measure, I included my TV Guide existing subscription number as part of that address to make it easier for the subscription department of TV Guide to combine my new subscription through Amazon with my existing one.",[],B003N3QRF8,B003N3QRF8,AHW7ETGBKGX6DCG2LBAG5YAXU46A,2011-11-27 03:36:19.000,4,True

5,much needed history resource for kids,"Cobblestone Magazine is advertised for grades four through nine.  It's all about American history.  Because there are so many controversial and delicate topics covered, I would encourage parents to think carefully about whether a younger child is prepared to read and discuss Cobblestone articles.  Gifted readers under eight who may be fine with the vocabulary and serious tone of the articles may be too sensitive to be exposed to the often dark content.  Recent sample issues covered D-day and the Allied invasion of Normandy, Ken Burns and his documentary on World War II, and John F. Kennedy.<br /><br />The D-Day issue includes a photo of a fallen soldier and the remark, ""Omaha Beach was littered with smashed vehicles and dead and dying men.""  This issue also has a great map of the invasion plan, military statistics, and profiles of key players in the war.  Churchill, F.D.R., Stalin, Eisenhower, and Hitler are among those covered.  There are also stories on code breaking,  engineering marvels, spies, and clever deceptions.  An interview with Buck Compton, real life hero portrayed in Spielberg and Hanks' ""Band of Brothers"" film, is another highlight.<br /><br />The issue on Ken Burns mentions the Bataan Death March and civilian families held for years in a  Manila prison camp.  Ken Burns has done a fabulous job of documenting so much important American History.  I am excited to see an entire issue devoted to his work.  His passion for history really helps to bring it alive and allows kids to understand that it's much more than a bunch of dates to memorize.<br /><br />The issue devoted to John F. Kennedy is balanced and fair. There is a story about his childhood, another about his experience with PT 109, and then a look at his campaign and the first televised Presidential debate.  A presidential time line details his time in office and there are articles on the cold war, Cuban missile crisis, and his assassination.  An interview with Caroline Kennedy informs readers about the JFK Library and the Profiles in Courage award.<br /><br />These issues are jammed with factual accounts, interviews, and terrific photos, as well as theme related crossword puzzles, cartoons, and ""brain ticklers"" which are actually short quizzes based on the content of the current issue.  Contests encourage readers to submit their own versions of World War II posters,<br />or to nominate a local good citizen.  Real kids offer reviews of theme related web sites and books.  There are also suggestions on places to visit, such as the National World War II Museum in New Orleans and in Washington D.C.<br /><br />I heartily recommend Cobblestone both to schools and individual families wishing to encourage  children to appreciate and respect American history.  If we don't pay attention to the past, how can we learn from it?",[],B00006K99Y,B00006K99Y,AHFAVTVOL2KUU4PRARH7ZJQOR75Q,2008-03-08 11:38:09.000,73,False
5,A winner!,"Odyssey Magazine-Adventures in Science is a great magazine for kids who are interested in science as well as those who might be with just a little nudge.  Target audience range is for grades 4-9.  As usual with Carus publications, there is no advertising other than information on how to purchase subscriptions to other Carus mags.<br /><br />Odyssey boasts of an impressive list of scholars on it's advisory panel.  Professors from Case Western, Harvard, Williams, and other well known institutions serve on the board.<br /><br />A recent issue all about milk was well balanced and presented very divergent viewpoints.  Regular feature, ""Science Scoops"" detailed a study that showed breast fed infants may not have an automatic advantage in IQ over their bottle fed counterparts.  The latest study points out that better educated and more intelligent mothers tend to nurse their babies, and that this may account for slightly higher than average test scores.  ""The (Almost) Perfect Food"" cites many benefits of milk and dairy in the human diet, but also mentions milk allergy and lactose intolerance.  PETA's point of view is discussed as well.  The activists in People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals regard confinement of dairy cows to be cruel.  A 12 year old girl contributes a nice piece on robotic milking machines, and we also have the opportunity to learn about the chemical compositionof milk, mammal milk substitutes, and cheese making.  A highly allergic 5th grader also shares his story on living with a milk allergy.<br /><br />Another sample issue deals with Edward O. Wilson, a brilliant entomologist known as ""the ant man"".  Wilson,  a Harvard professor and  prolific writer, is a believer in the importance of biodiversity.  His passion for his work comes through clearly in the pages of Odyssey.  Articles in this issue include, ""E.O. Wilson, Boy Naturalist"", Edward O. Wilson, Friend and Ant Man"", ""Ants Rule!"", ""See the World in a Tree Trunk"", and more.<br /><br />Regular departments appearing in each Odyssey are Activities to Discover, Science Scoops, Ask a Scientist, Brain Strain, Kids Can..., Ask Dr. Cy Borg, Star Chart, Star Gazing with Jack Horkheimer, You've Got Mail, Kids' Picks, and Animal Angles.<br /><br />My kids enjoy Odyssey and I am pleased to recommend yet another top notch magazine from Carus.",[],B00006KR0U,B00006KR0U,AHFAVTVOL2KUU4PRARH7ZJQOR75Q,2008-01-05 13:26:04.000,28,False
5,Ask is amazing!,"Ask Magazine is another wonderful publication from the originators of Cricket.  Ask is all about arts and sciences, with each issue having one unifying theme.  The recommended age range is from seven to ten, but younger fluent readers can also enjoy Ask.<br /><br />Ask contains regular features as well as a variety of articles related to the central theme.  ""Scoops"" is a two page spread of science news and discoveries.  One story might be on a robotic arm, another on the acquisition of  language in sac-winged bats.  ""Nestor's Dock"" is a double page cartoon with enjoyable recurring characters.  Each issue also has a contest which ties in with the theme.  The water issue asks readers to design a fountain, the learning issue requests that readers design a school, and an art issue invites readers to copy their favorite work of art.  Winners have their entries printed in a future issue. ""Jimmy and the Bug"" is another regular feature.  Here, readers questions are answered in cartoon format.  Questions might appear simple, ""Why do lions have manes?"" or more complex, "" what are the rings around planets made of?""  Answers are both thoughtful and informative.  Every issue ends with the silly but sweet cartoon,  ""Marvin and Friends"", on the back cover.<br /><br />The ""Making Art"" issue of Ask includes a lovely piece on quilting traditions in rural Alabama.  Many beautiful photos of quilts are displayed alongside comments from their creators.  In the same edition, ""Playing with Mud"" showcases delicate Korean celadon pottery.<br /><br />""The Liquid of Life"" issue of Ask has a fascinating story on water.  It covers the water cycle, water forms, a water molecule diagram, and gorgeous photographs of a water droplet, snowflake, and children and animals in various poses with rain and snow.  Information offered can be quite complex, but it is just the thing for feeding hungry young intellects.  This issue also has water trivia cards, with intriguing questions such as, what can go longer without water, a camel, or a giraffe? An article on water powered generators is very well done, and the issue is rounded out with a nice tour of bogs, fens, swamps, and marshes.<br /><br />I'm very pleased to recommend Ask.  It's funny but not obnoxious, informative but not controversial,  with articles a bit shorter and lighter than those found in big brother's Muse Magazine.",[],B00006FXOV,B00006FXOV,AHFAVTVOL2KUU4PRARH7ZJQOR75Q,2007-10-25 05:28:51.000,159,False
5,A delightful magazine,"Spider Magazine is a dream come true for the young gifted reader. The magazine is pitched for children ages six to nine. Strong independent readers may be ready for it earlier. Sample issues run to 33 pages, plus each has an additional  pullout paper craft. There is a lot of writing packed into this little mag and the very  youngest subscribers might prefer to have Mom, Dad, or big sister share the joy.<br /><br />Issues of Spider have a fairly predictable pattern. This is a positive for most of the target audience, who are young enough to find comfort in predictability. The publishing information is tucked into a tiny box on the inside front cover. A lovely drawing of Spider's Mailbox takes up the rest of the page, as well as all of the first page. This is the backdrop against which Spider and her little buggy friends cavort in unique poses each month. My daughter could tell you exactly who the bugs are and all about their personalities, but I'm not quite as Spider savy as she. Suffice it to say that she follows the antics of these little characters with glee, as they appear on page bottoms throughout each issue. The bugs are well loved by readers and they all receive fanmail.<br /><br />The Danderfield Twins is a recurring feature and the first story in each Spider magazine. The twins and their friends are a lively and intelligent bunch, who often must work together to solve a problem. These stories are short and sweet, running about six pages long with large type and plenty of illustrations. Other stories, puzzles, and poems may follow a particular theme. One issue appeared to have two themes, both trains and dogs. A recipe for peanutbutter dog biscuits was a pleasant surprise here.<br /><br />Illustrations in the magazine are bright and appealing. I heartily appreciate the fact that there is no advertising whatsoever included in Spider. This is very refreshing and a significant demonstration of Carus Publishing's commitment to fair marketing.<br /><br />Near the back of each issue is a department known as Spider's Corner. Reader artwork and poetry is shared here, with an invitation to submit a drawing or poem on a given idea. One request is for farm animal pictures, another for poems about pets.",[],B00006FXOT,B00006FXOT,AHFAVTVOL2KUU4PRARH7ZJQOR75Q,2007-06-12 17:47:36.000,164,False
5,My son reads it cover to cover!,"Muse is an exceptional magazine.  Though it is aimed at ""tweens"", gifted readers from about age 7 up can appreciate it.  Parents may wish to pre-read or discuss controversial pieces with their children. There are plenty of interesting articles on a variety of topics. Recent issues have covered stone disks in the Yap islands, gamers making real money from selling virtual goods,  racial prejudice, genetics, and snowflakes.<br /><br /> Muse magazine does not contain any advertising, other than subscription offers from the publisher.  It's quite refreshing.  Some of my family's other magazines (Sports Illustrated Kids, for example) are filled with ads for junk food and toys.<br /><br />A full page in Muse is always devoted to  Larry Gonick's ""Kokopelli & Company"", a cartoon featuring the magazine's quirky cartoon mascots.  These tiny creatures also cavort on pages throughout the magazine.  Bo's Page is another regular feature.  Here, readers may learn about a scientific experiment to discover how ants find their way home, or why gorillas eat wood, and  vote as to whether  humans will survive to the year 2100.  The Q & A section has answers to queries submitted by readers.  Examples questions are ""would time travel actually be possible?"" and ""what happens when you blow a (soap) bubble in winter?"" .  Robert Coontz and Rosanne Spector provide clear, and often humorous, answers.  Ivars Peterson is the Muse math guru.  His ""Math Page""  offers suduko challenges and other math puzzles as well as articles such as ""The Simpsons and Math"".  Every issue of Muse offers a contest of some sort, tucked into the corner of a two page spread honoring winners of the previous issue's contest.  Kids are invited to become living art in a tableau vivant, or to design imaginary money.<br /><br />I highly recommend Muse for both boys and girls.",[],B00006FXOP,B00006FXOP,AHFAVTVOL2KUU4PRARH7ZJQOR75Q,2005-10-17 12:45:02.000,279,True
4,I knew what I was getting - willing to pay extra for good copy editing,"I knew when I subscribed that I was getting the Kindle version and that there would be an expensive auto renewal. I'm okay with it, but I wouldn't be if I hadn't known what to expect.<br /><br />I am willing to pay what I consider to be an exorbitant price for a magazine (omg!) because the writing and the reporting are stellar. I'm not a grammar or spelling fascist, which should be obvious from this review (and all of them). However, when writers are being paid for their work, and copy editors are being paid to correct it, I expect to see very few errors. And no really terrible ones. This magazine does pretty well, which means that I will pay what it takes to keep excellent writers and editors employed.<br /><br />As for the content? The reviews, fiction, and poetry are the main draws for me. The news articles are well-researched and well-written, but they come from clear points of view (i.e., they are not strictly objective).

5,Five Stars from a Landscape Designer,"I do landscape design and landscape maintenance professionally, and this is the only magazine I'd recommend to clients. As another reviewer noted, The American Gardener is also a fine publication if you are very serious about plants, but for most readers, Fine Gardening best walks the line between accessability and having great information.<br /><br />I have been a subscriber for eight years and have kept every issue. The information on the spine is clear and so you can easily find that elusive article you remembered and wanted to refer to, without pulling out every issue and having to look at the cover.<br /><br />As a professional, I find the in-depth articles on different kinds of plants really helpful. It is neat to focus on say, all the different kinds of Forsythias around, so you can really compare the varieties available and know all of your options if you would like to plant one. They usually have six or more photos of the different varieties, with each photo highlighting an important aspect of the plant's habit, foliage, or bloom, plus a few photos of the plants used in a garden, so you can see what kinds of textures and colors the plant works with.<br /><br />The articles on landscape design are by well-respected professionals and offer a wonderful balance of intellectually interesting discussion and gorgeous photos. They don't always tell us exactly which plant is which in each photo, so that would be a drawback to the new gardener who isn't familiar with a number of plants, but they usually only neglect to name the plants when the photo is trying to illustrate a design concept. I think they find a good balance between urban gardening/ gardening in small spaces, and gardening in a more country or spacious setting.<br /><br />They also have articles on seasonal care (and as a reader for eight years, I haven't found any articles that are overlap or repeats), articles on broader topics like groundovers for shade or grasses in the garden (in which they usually include a large and useful list of plants, organized by foliage and flower color, size, sun needs, zone, etc), and profiles on the latest tools, books and other gardening needs.<br /><br />I have read a lot of gardening magazines over the years and Fine Gardening is by far the best. The language is simple yet the ideas are not dumbed down. Most other magazines have huge amounts of distracting advertisements, and Fine Gardening's are related to gardening, useful, and not too prolific.<br /><br />Recommended.",[],B000063XJI,B000063XJI,AFPF2CONJ33FNFKOEQ2TUNWQJTFQ,2006-02-05 03:49:54.000,47,False

4,A decent fitness magazine IF you can overlook the flaws,"About two years ago, I became a subscriber to Shape, mainly because I had received it for free as part of a package deal with another magazine.  I had always liked browsing through issues of Shape in the supermarket, and I thought that being a subscriber would help support my fitness goals.  Overall, I have enjoyed Shape and found it to be useful, but there definitely are some negatives, and the magazine might not be for everyone.<br /><br />But first the good.  Like many others have mentioned, what I most enjoy about Shape is their real-life weight stories featuring a nice variety of women, some of whom actually needed to *gain* weight in order to be healthy.  I also love their relatively new feature in which they follow one of their own staffers on a year-long weight loss journey.  Many of their other regular features are also excellent, particularly the body part-focused strength exercises and other how-to exercise guides.  And I especially like that Shape uses ""Reader Models"" with so many of their articles--real life women of various ages (although admittedly, mostly in the 25-35 range) with normal, healthy, strong bodies.  Finally, their featured exercise plans each month often offer some unique variations on traditional exercises, and the recipes are often quite good as well.<br /><br />The main negative has already been brought up by many others here:  the use of too-skinny, not overtly fit or strong models to illustrate much of the magazine.  I find this extremely disappointing; I understand that to sell magazines, the models probably have to conform to some traditional standards of attractiveness, but those of us buying the magazine want to see women who are not only fit but also strong--show us some muscles now and then!  As I said above, the reader models are great; the women are usually quite fit, but they have muscles and curves too, which is wonderful to see.  Shape MAY be trying to make some improvements in this area, as the last few covers have featured famous women who do exercise (such as Denise Richards), but they still have a long way to go.  And while they're at it, I hope they will return to having their cover models dress in fitness wear, not bathing suits!  They can still show off their model's physique AND showcase cute fitness wear at the same time.  Similarly, I would like to see the magazine get rid of the fashion segment at the end *unless* they start focusing it on exercise clothing, not haute couture.<br /><br />If you are overweight and/or new to exercising, you may find the magazine discouraging, but if you can get past some of the negatives, it can also be inspiring.  I think it's up to each individual to determine whether a magazine like this is likely to hurt or help her fitness efforts; for me, it is helpful, but this definitely might not be the case with everyone.",[],B00005N7SN,B00005N7SN,AFIJLAW3HIOMRUFSWNH54IJ3XQAA,2006-09-18 16:50:46.000,14,False
4,Nice holistic heath and wellness magazine geared mainly towards women,"I've been a subscriber to Body + Soul magazine for about a year now, and I look forward to each new issue.  The magazine focuses on many areas of interest to me, including healthy eating, holistic health, fitness, and personal growth.  The articles frequently feature practical things like recipes, buying guides, yoga or other fitness instructions, and emotional exercises (the latter of which I find particularly helpful in my work as a psychologist).  My only complaints about this magazine is that there is a bit too much of a focus on spiritual/meditation type issues, which are less relevant to me, and that the magazine is on the short side with a high number of advertisements.

Each issue includes a beginner's look at a particular asana plus an in-depth depth focus on a more advanced asana; featured articles include more posture work as well as more general health and wellness topics.  Whenever I pick up this magazine, I never fail to find several articles of interest to me, and I always wind up saving the issue for future reference.<br /><br />Yoga Journal is definitely a worthwhile subscription or occasional indulgence for your well-being; highly recommended for yogis of all levels!",[],B00016JENW,B00016JENW,AFIJLAW3HIOMRUFSWNH54IJ3XQAA,2004-02-18 15:19:21.000,30,False
3,May be on the rebound,"...I've been disappointed in many of the changes to the magazine since that time.  More specifically, when long-time editor Ruth Whitney was replaced with the editor of Cosmopolitan (whose name I can't recall), the magazine seemed to transform into ""Cosmo light"":  it was suddenly filled with articles on celebrities and sex, and some of my favorite features (such as the book recommendations) disappeared.  I missed the more intelligent magazine of my earlier years and considered cancelling my subscription, but because I was still deriving some enjoyment from the entertainment features, I continued reading.  A few years ago, a new editor, Cynthia Leive, took over, and since then, there has been another--although less dramatic--transformation.  The celebrity and sex features are still there, but now they're balanced by more intelligent articles (and yes, my book recommendations have returned!).

I don't like many scents and a number of them make me nauseous, so I pull the things out immediately and put them in the farthest-away-from-me recycling bin. Even so, the scents still linger in the paper, especially on the facing pages, so I have to wash my hands after touching the magazine--something that cuts deeply into my enjoyment of Vogue and other mags with perfume sample ads. What's still great are the personal experience essays. Vogue has always had the best writers and the most interesting takes. Some of the fashion pages are still gorgeous, though many seem like recycled versions with poses we've already seen other models do better, or photos where the clothes can't be seen in the landscape or lighting used. With the poses, I don't know if the fault is the model's, because she has a limited range of poses, expressions or emotions, or if the fault is the editor's for choosing clothes or photos that look alike, but there's a lot too much sameness to the magazine recently. I look back longingly at Grace Coddington's amazing 1920s shoot, or the Versailles spread with those incredible clothes and stunning model with her gift for inventive poses that still let us see what she's wearing, or the Alice in Wonderland shoot--all examples of the best fashion photography available--and I hope Vogue gets a renewed jolt of the creativity, craftsmanship and professional pride that has made it an exemplar.",[],B001U5SPK6,B001U5SPK6,AEAWAXEYKUGM5BW6B5OCEMXZQE2Q,2016-12-26 14:33:26.000,78,True
2,"If you want clothes that fit and make you look great, don't bother with these","Ugly ill-fitting poorly made clothes. I subscribed to this magazine because of the many positive reviews, but after 2 issues in which I found only one pattern I would choose to sew, I am not renewing. These are not atttactive patterns. Many are unfitted, so they emphasize the model's weight, and many of the samples are poorly sewn, with puckered seams all too evident. In addition too many of the patterns look essentially the same-- the first issue had 3 peasant dresses for instance. Very disappointing.",[],B00006K6WG,B00006K6WG,AEAWAXEYKUGM5BW6B5OCEMXZQE2Q,2015-09-24 22:53:15.000,1,True

4,"informative, interesting, good layperson level","NewScientist is a lot of fun to read and keeps you up to date with some of the newest science being done. It's a nice laypersons' coverage. It doesn't approach Scientific American in its depth, complexity, or ""sciency"" language, but it's popularized rather than dumbed down. The writing is always clear and concise.  I'd say it probably is not as simplified or ""newsy"" as Discover (which I also read and enjoy), putting it in a nice middle category of science for laypeople magazines.  It comes weekly, which I really appreciate.<br /><br />It has a ""this week"" section which covers a few topics in short fashion (1/2 to 1 page articles), then an ""In Brief"" section which covers more topics, um, in brief (usually 1/4 page articles).  There are a few pages of brief Technology articles (1/3rd to 1 page articles), a science-based editorial, an interview or two, and then several longer, in-depth articles, including the cover article. These are usually 3 or 4 pages with the cover article 4-6 pages.  Recent cover topics  have been the Higgs, Memory, Neutrinos.  The magazine closes with some book reviews, a feedback section, and a question-to-the editors section.  I write and I find myself often clipping out articles of interest or of use.  Even better, a subscription gives you their entire on-line archive, as well as regular email updates.

Don't expect coverage of modern war or pretty much anything in the last thirty years. Occasional stories on the cold war pop up here or there, but for the most part WWII/Korea is the end point on their coverage timeline.

5,"Literate, Global News Magazine","My sons, who both have degrees in Economics - one is getting a PhD in Economics - recommended that I read this magazine.  One son said he wished I would read it so we could discuss it.  Anytime your offspring want to talk to you, that's an incentive.<br /><br />I am impressed with the organization of this magazine. It opens with The world this week and Leaders and Briefing. It is then organized by geography: United States, The Americas, Asia, China, Middle East and Africa, Europe, Britain and International with a special section on Brazil in this issue.  Then it covers topics: Business, Finance and economics, Schools brief, Science and technology, Books and arts and Economic and financial indicators.<br /><br />I like the global perspective this magazine offers with the U.S. just being one player.  Articles are deep and comprehensive with information that isn't easily available elsewhere in mainstream publications.  This week the cover article is on the extraordinary comeback of al-Qaeda and how it holds sway over more territory and is recruiting more fighters than any time in its 25 year history.  In Iraq since we left prematurely, the magazine indicates, over 1000 civilians a month are being murdered by al-Qaeda.  Al-Qaeda wants to bring Iraq, Syria and Lebanon together into a single caliphate.  Those are just some of the interesting facts in this magazine. While reading it, I felt I was immersed in a high-level course in international politics and economics.<br /><br />If you read this magazine every week, in a short time you would be up to date and literate on global issues and economics.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book review of the new book on Salinger in this issue.<br /><br />If you read every article thoroughly, it would take several hours.  My son likes to read it on the train to New York City and gets it in paper and online form.  I'll be reading it weekly now so I can discuss it with my sons.",[],B002PXVYDW,B002PXVYDW,AE6U2ZCGCBRDU3TT3PVH44ITRLOA,2013-09-28 02:57:44.000,5,False

It made me want to read her books after reading how she structured them.<br /><br />If you like reading about the field of writing, and are thinking of entering it or are writing already for publication, this magazine offers insight about the writing world from real writers.

Its cover trumpets the words ""For everyone who hasn't read everything.""  I just received my first issue and found it so visually pleasing. It is aesthetically a delight to enter and read around in.  It welcomes the reader to enter and sit a spell with its attractive color, print, lay-out, format, and paper stock.<br /><br />There are fun features such as the monthly ""Selections"" ""Coming in Paperback"", ""Awards"", biographies on authors and my favorite section: ""Coming Soon"" books.  My only recommendation for the magazine is that ""Coming Soon"" section be doubled as there's plenty of information available on books already out, but bibliophiles love to know what they don't know about books and don't have easy access to--what books are going to be published in the next 6 months?<br /><br />Loved the ""Best of 2011"" chart in the most recent issue in which a chart of the best books of 2011 selected by the major publications are listed.<br /><br />It's great to have book selections with choice excepts from a mix of reviews from leading newspapers and outlets combined with this magazine's summary of the book.  As long as I keep reading, I will keep subscribing to this magazine.",[],B0000AJLX9,B0000AJLX9,AE6U2ZCGCBRDU3TT3PVH44ITRLOA,2012-03-02 19:27:28.000,14,True
5,Great Magazine for Writers,"If you love to write and love to read, you may be fascinated by the magic--the science and art--behind the craft of writing and publication.  This magazine explores these topics.  If you want to immerse yourself in the world of writing for publication, you should enjoy this magazine which examines writing/publication through multiple facets.<br /><br />Currently in its 125th year of publication--this magazine was created in 1887 by two Boston Globe reporters--the magazine's mission is unchanged: ""to inspire, instruct and inform writers at all skill levels"". Sounds good.<br /><br />And the current magazine reflects this mission.  I enjoyed articles on topics including ""Ask the Writer"" in which a contemporary writer is asked a question about his/her craft, Writing Life Tips, Social Media, Key to Complex Characters, a Writer's Success Story, Step-by-Step-Get Your Story Started, an essay on the writing life, reviews of books for writers and a substantive interview with acclaimed writer Ken Follett.<br /><br />This year the magazine will have articles on lists by authors: their favorite fictional characters, favorite beach reads, collection of writing prompts, best opening lines, best movies made from books etc. I especially enjoyed the writing prompts.<br /><br />The magazine appears to cover all kinds of writing: screenwriting, historical novels, memoirs, non-fiction etc.  There is information on MFA programs for writing and upcoming writing conferences. At the end of the magazine there is a directory of agents, contests, conferences and publishers.<br /><br />I really enjoy perusing this magazine which includes a wealth of information about the field of writing.  It would be especially helpful to aspiring and new writers, or writers wanting to keep learning about their craft from other writers including the best in the field.  It would also be great for writing classes. It's a fun read for anyone who enjoys books and writing.",[],B00008GT3F,B00008GT3F,AE6U2ZCGCBRDU3TT3PVH44ITRLOA,2012-02-14 20:03:04.000,19,True

5,VERANDA Virtuosity!,"VERANDA reigns along with the other three most beautiful and stylish U.S. shelter magazines today: Architectural Digest, Elle Decor and House Beautiful. What I like about VERANDA is the photography and rooms dominate and the text takes a supporting role.  The magazine features many full-page and double-page spreads of gorgeous rooms with not a lot of text interrupting.  Design is one of the fields in which you can learn by just studying a room in detail to get a sense of the scale, proportion, balance of texture and light and shadow etc.<br /><br />You are training your eye in what the best designers find beautiful.  A full and double-page spread allows you to do that better than smaller, choppier photos. It's great to have more visual, less words in which the rooms triumph. More to see--less to read. There's enough text in VERANDA to get into the designers'/homeowners' minds. VERANDA'S lush heavy paper stock is a joy, too, and increases the aesthetic experience.  The photos of the rooms look spectacular on it.<br /><br />VERANDA features eclectic styles and locations.

Its tone is not light, though it is very readable. An MBA is not required.<br /><br />Not as in-depth as publications like the ""Wall Street Journal,"" it does, however, highlight news necessary to serious Eastern European investors. Major articles on the current tax situation, work force issues, hedge funds and market trends all indicate that BBJ is working hard. The pieces indicate research and investigation, with a committed effort to examine all sides of the questions.<br /><br />BBJ follows the personalities, movers and shakers, and trends that impact Hungary, with increasing news about the European Union. Commentaries and editorials are pro-Hungary, recognizing the great difficulty the region has, but the potential Hungary has as a leading financial center. As optimistic as the editorial staff is about the continued economic redemption of Hungary, articles lean honestly about the struggles and hurdles ahead.<br /><br />Features include reviews of restaurants and entertainment, and presumes many readers are not regular visitors to Budapest.<br /><br />Advertising is geared toward expats with higher incomes, with nicer restaurants, corporate services, and luxury travel filling the ad space.<br /><br />While a meatier newspaper would be helpful, this is a good start.

4,Daily Devotional for Men,"Imagine ""Our Daily Bread,"" written in a more contemporary tone, slanted for a male audience. Then add stiff subscription ads. That's ""Men of Integrity.""<br /><br />""Men of Integrity"" is an anecdotal, vignette-driven daily devotional magazine. Like ""Our Daily Bread,"" it takes the reader into a Scripture with some challenges. It is not as deep as ""My Utmost for His Highest,"" or as spiritually pushing, but it does serve a good purpose.<br /><br />Topics in the issue in my hand include racism, reconciliation, marital infidelity, corruption, children and fatherhood, profanity, commitment to attending church, and temptation. A weekly roundup sums up each week with questions to remind the reader.<br /><br />For the man on the go, the one who is not ready or willing to read Scripture at length, this is perfect. It is small, slipping easily into a pocket for lunchtime or train-ride reading. It is bimonthly, and supplies two months worth of devotionals.<br /><br />A thoughtful man could spend 30 minutes on each day's chapter, reading through the biblical passages and thinking through the questions. A casual reader will finish it in five minutes.<br /><br />Cobranded by ""Promises Keepers,"" Christianity Today holds true to its mission, ""To engage, encourage, and equip the church worldwide, sharing the depth and transforming power of the Gospel as it permeates all spheres of life.""<br /><br />The only real negative is the ad cards stitched in.

5,"Practical, Educational, Nicely Presented","There are a few magazines about writing serious writers need to read. ""Poets & Writers"" is one of them. It has a literary bent, but avoids the nose-in-the-air attitude. It is practical and educational, and is pleasingly presented.<br /><br />A favorite factor for me are the long feature articles on the culture of writing. In the issue out now, there are two major articles. One is about author Stuart Dybek and his fiction that pulls from his experience growing up on Chicago's colorful South Side. The other is about writing contests, dealing with how ethical they are run, the view of literary judges, and when a writer should considering entering one.<br /><br />The secondary articles are as informative and as useful, whether you want to learn about promoting your book, doing online workshops or understand the trends driving the industry.<br /><br />Contests, incidentally, are a big part of PW's value. The magazine tells you who won, and which contests/grants are currently accepting submissions. PW is careful to screen which contests are listed, ensuring only legitimate ones make it through the editors.<br /><br />The writing itself is interesting. It is not always true that writing magazines are fun to read. It should be, and in the case of PW, everything is engaging.<br /><br />PW's design is clean. It looks like what a small press literary magazine should look like. The typography and layout are not pretentious or overbearing, but get the job done.

5,"Meaty, Challenging, Instructive","""Discipleship Journal"" does what many other Christian magazines do not do. It provides instruction, and challenges the reader to be directly and fully engaged in a Christ-focused faith. While others may talk about Christianity, DJ asks you to pursue Christ through responding to Scripture.<br /><br />This isn't an evangelistic magazine, like ""Decision,"" or an encouraging magazine, per se, like ""Moody."" It is for the Christian looking to grow in his or her faith by examining themselves and what God's word says.<br /><br />It is not for the passive pew sitter. This for the Christian who wants his or her faith to impact the days between Sundays.<br /><br />There is nothing watered-down here. It is published by NavPress, who, like their counterparts, the college ministry Navigators, know the crucial necessity of biblical study by the everyday Christian. Whether it is a discussion about Satan's favorite lies, how to study a particular book of the Bible, or an explanation of what prayer is an is not, DJ is the sort of publication that will cause you to pause mid-page and realize something new about our Lord and his ways.<br /><br />This is a great tool for two or three people to use together. Even a small group... to go through the articles, week by week and discuss them and what this means in real life. I've even heard of CCD and Sunday school classes asking everyone to read selections from a certain issue as fodder for the next week's class.<br /><br />I fully recommend ""Discipleship Journal.""

However, as the Christian world is farther reaching than evangelicalism, so reaches ""Christianity Today."" CT remains steady and solid in its views, and helps educates the well-read Christian.<br /><br />Mixing pop-news, hard-hitting issues, and intriguing features, CT manages to cover and assess the present state of Christianity. With a core of intelligent thinkers, and seasoned journalists, CT has been the leader in Christian journalism, and sets the pace for its peers.<br /><br />Articles are often passed around Sunday School and CCD classes to educate the layman what is going on in the modern Christian life, helping connect the year 33 AD with 2002 AD.<br /><br />Though coming from a protestant slant, Catholics and Orthodox Christians would be well-served to explore this magazine, as the movements of world Christianity are followed and reported. For example, they have done a great job reporting and analyzing the issues surrounding the Irish Catholic-Protestant conflict, separating the socio-political from the religious points of view.<br /><br />A great buy.

3,Mixed Review,"""Charisma"" magazine has gone through positive and negative changes in the last 10 years.<br /><br />What once was a lighthouse for charimastic Christians has evolved into a less discriminating publication. ""Charisma"" seems to have lost sight of the necessary theological assessment of varying beliefs. In a New Age, everything-might-be-true spiritual environment we live in, they need to be more cognizant of the challenges on charimastic belief.<br /><br />In tough issues like the Browsnville Revival and the Toronto Blessing, ""Charisma"" should be tougher. Analyze it, ""Charisma,"" don't wait for the media to tear it apart.<br /><br />Likewise, ""Charisma"" isn't strong enough when imposters come to town, chasing money in the name of a faulty health and wealth theology. Similarly, the cult of personalities in charimatic movements is terribly rampant and ignored by church leaders. No other charismatic publication is taking these issues to task, but ""Charisma"" is in the best position to do so.<br /><br />However, there are some good things. ""Charisma"" is the best of its lot. There simply are not other well-written, well-designed magazines or charismatic Christians. They do report solidly on religious persecution issues. They also cover the news of the Christian church at-large effectively, almost as well as the more news-based ""Christianity Today.""<br /><br />Three stars? Yep.

4,"Mix of Oprah, ""Sports Illustrated"" and ""Running Times""","Hardcore runners will read ""Runner's World"" because they have to. It popularizes the sport, and brings newcomers 'up to speed' about issues and techniques important to them, as well as clues them in on who is who out on the road. a great magazine, except I simply prefer the depth of training and racing issues ""Running Times"" provides a bit more. Really... I wish I could've given this magazine a 3.9.<br /><br />Running is a funky subculture, and ""Runner's World"" defines and educates that culture.<br /><br />Since the late George Sheehan wrote his famous column that emphasized running as spiritual endeavor, ""Runner's World"" has taken on an Oprah Winfrey/Deepak Chopra sort of generalist running philosophy. That's not all bad, as I think the magazine thoroughly encourages fitness through running.<br /><br />It isn't all fluff. There is plenty for the more avid runner to soak up.

I want to know how I can serve Christ Monday-Friday. Explain to me the Liturgy... why are various aspects of it important? What about what the Bible says about alcohol, or daily prayer? How about defining Mary's official role, dispelling the mistaken belief than she is equal to Christ (the question of veneration versus worship)?<br />The Protestant magazines are loaded with accounts about how God changed their lives. I'd like to see more of that. The Protestants have lots of Bible studies and that sort of thing in their magazines. Do I have to buy a Protestant magazine like &quot;Discipleship Journal&quot; &quot;Moody Monthly&quot; to learn how to be a better Christian? They're fine, but it seems with the long history of great theologians, someone could get a Catholic variation on all of that.<br />I think Catholic Digest is the best publication offered for Catholics.

5,Excellent publication! Informative and enjoyable.,"I am a homeowner with a wife and three small kids. I may be the target audience for &#34;The Family Handyman&#34; magazine. I'm not a die-hard DIYer, but I'm eager to learn if I have the time, the job doesn't require specialized training or certification, and the cost savings is there. I absolutely love this magazine and read it cover to cover. The information contained within is worthy of placing the back-issues onto my ever-shrinking book shelf. I've ditched many of my other how-to books. Most of the time I just search the Internet for the knowledge I need, but sometimes I don't even know what I don't know (if you know what I mean). &#34;The Family Handyman&#34; discusses things like preventative maintenance on your home, how to select quality materials for your project, and how to make your DIY project a little cleaner and safer. They also describe the function of tools and explain the use of materials. The diversity of the articles means that I find something in every issue. For example, I'm able to build a wall and install a sink but I'm not as informed about concrete or roofing. This magazine is wonderfully informative, with well written and illustrated articles. I highly recommend for anyone with aspirations of being the family handyman (or handywoman).",[],B002PXVYEQ,B002PXVYEQ,AGF2IEKZZWRUE66HQSQBLTWI5ZYA,2018-07-31 14:31:28.361,2,True

I'm also interested in sustainable living and emergency preparedness. The past few issues of Field and Stream that I've purchased have offered excellent information on fishing, emergency preparedness, hiking, camping, and wildlife preservation. I've also enjoyed their campfire recipes, gardening tips, and product reviews for things like binoculars, backpacks, firearms, and fishing equipment. Their articles seem to be written by very intelligent, nature-loving individuals that have a passion for wildlife preservation and a lot of outdoor experience.

If you want to follow trends, Gourmet is a great magazine.  If you DON'T live in NYC, Gourmet has mostly forgotten about you.  That, my friend, is why I give it only 3*.  As a culinary professional who worked from Miami up to the St. Lawrence River in Upstate NY, I had often read the magazine and wondered, sometimes not even quietly, why the writers and editors were so stuck on the City.  If you didn't life there, you didn't matter.  That was the basic philosophy.<br /><br />On the plus side, the articles were usually well written, the interviews decent and the recipes interesting.

It's when the profit and bottom line becomes the focal point that problems arise.<br /><br />I will still read Reader's Digest.  I will no longer subscribe to them.

While it centers around the Smithsonian's world, it will take you, as an explorer to archaeological sites and discoveries worldwide.  From the comfort of your easy chair, recliner or couch, you can journey the world and back in as little as a few minutes to several hours, depending on how much you might read and your actual reading habits.  (I know I often get interrupted while trying to read a story.)<br /><br />This is well written, professionally written material.  This sates the explorer in us all and allows us to see, for the price of subscription, things I could never afford to see or place to go in life.  While having spent 20+ years in the U.S. Navy and being quite well traveled from it, I don't often come across articles of things I've seen or places I've been.  I'm saying this in a positive way.

Nat Geo has allowed generations upon generations of readers to travel the world from the comfort of their own home.  For the price of a subscription one could learn, exp!ore, visit and understand nations, communities and peoples newly discovered and those long known.<br /><br />One of the most amazing things about National Geographic is how long some people hold on to them.  It is not uncommon to come across bundles from the 40s, 50s and 60s.

Given that fact, many pages are nothing but either ads or infomercials.  Once past that, there really IS a good magazine hidden between those pages.<br /><br />I have been an on again and off again subscriber since the early 80s when I returned to the U.S. after a five year stint in the military living in Europe.  You might find it odd but this magazine helped with my transition to the land of consumerism and commercialism.<br /><br />Good Housekeeping keeps up with trends and ideas for the modern home.  From solar water systems to water heated floors, from pink rose pedals to rose hip tea, GH has been there.  Given the duration this magazine has been in operation, earning a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval is sometimea a boon to business and that push needed for national recognition.<br /><br />GH is NOT a controversial magazine.

That said, anyone who wrote a recipe and had it published was considered an editor.<br /><br />This WAS a great magazine for the home cook.

Something along the lines of smoked paprika might have been considered &#34;classy&#34; or even foreign.  Today, with Reader's Digest at the helm, it's a different magazine.  Gone are the days of no advertisements (subscriptions paid for the publishing and profit) and it is now filled with big glossy photos of food, kitchen and body related items that the publishers feel you cannot live without.  I, for one, can live without them.<br /><br />Having spend more than 20 years in the culinary business from the bottom of the chain to operator and now educator, I would occasionally use Taste of Home for a &#34;comfort food selection&#34;.  These particular recipes would be given to the newest of the new cooks to prepare and have ready for service.<br /><br />Taste of Home still has decent recipes.

5,Great support for vegans,"I used to subscribe to Vegetarian Times and liked that magazine, but got tired of always having to adjust recipes to veganize them.  Plus, I don't feel that dairy even belongs in the human diet, so it bugged me that so many of those recipes revolved around it. Veg News is great support for vegans and I love finding out about new products on the market that make my life easier.  I've been a vegetarian for 30+ years and a vegan for a good part of that and it just keeps getting easier and easier.  I don't much care for cooking though, so I'm always looking for shortcuts.  Beware that the focus of the magazine is not necessarily health oriented.  There is an awful lot of ink devoted to vegan sugary treats and vegan faux meats that I don't personally eat or need in my diet, but the idea is to show how doable veganism is for anyone that is entertaining the idea but fears that life will be one bland meal after another.  Veg News demonstrates that it doesn't have to be and that there are tons of alturnatives out there that don't require the death (or suffering, in the case of dairy production) of our beloved animals.  On those occasions that I'm feeling unplugged and like I'm the only vegan on the planet (or at least in my family) it's comforting to tap into the enthusiasm of many others that know that we're clearly on to something good and have been for some time.

5,Nothing even compares,"I became familiar with this magazine while we were in South Africa. It really raised my cooking game. The recipes are so much more intricate (but not that much more difficult) and more varied than in the US food magazines.<br /><br />There's been a little bit of a dip, I think, since a new editor started; somehow her quest to ""freshen it up"" took some of the depth away from it, but I still think it's the best cooking/food magazine published. My second vote, surprisingly, is TASTE magazine, published by Woolworth's, which, in South Africa is a gourmet supermarket and classy department store. Both magazines really get your imagination going and inspire you to cook things that really are ""over the top"" without being ridiculously difficult. Given my work schedule, if I can't make it in 20 minutes (except for those very special occasions), I'm not interested.<br /><br />Yes, the subscription is ridiculously expensive. It's something I consider an extravagance, but given how much of a positive effect it has had on our daily meals, and the fact that my husband doesn't even want to go to restaurants anymore ""because your cooking is so much better,"" I figure we're coming out ahead economically. You can easily spend the same amount for a nice dinner these days - and for the subscription cost of this magazine I get many, many more good meals out of it in a given year. I read it slowly, one page at a time, while eating. Always a pleasure.<br /><br />If you just can't bring yourself to spend this much for the printed magazine, at least visit their website - delicious.co.uk - for some inspiration.",[],B000225SRG,B000225SRG,AGOPRH75EYZBOTLBZYFNEUSI3ZBQ,2012-05-20 17:52:17.000,9,True

1,Nothing like it used to be.,"European Car is a magazine full of eye candy.  Lots of German and Italian uber-exotics grace its pages.  While that's great, and it's enjoyable to read about such cars, EC has lost many subscribers due to its loss of focus on the more attainable European cars out there.  The pages used to be full of VW, BMW, Audi and Porsche project cars that were all within reach of your average Joe with a taste for something other than the basic Camaro or Mustang.  Many used Euro cars are very cheap and easy to get into for those that would otherwise not be able to buy a new car of the same make. I'd hoped that the focus on these cars would become more intense when Les Bidrawn took over as editor a few years back.  Unfortunately, it appeared to me that that's when things really seemed to go downhill.  I let my subscription lapse and can't see picking it back up unless the mag undergoes a major transformation.  So if you're into top dollar, unattainable by all but the very few, exotic European cars, this is your mag.  But if you are someone who just likes your basic European offerings and is looking for support and inspiration, you stand a good chance of being disappointed.",[],B00007AX2M,B00007AX2M,AHERXMLUSO5PBEEJFRK2SVTFPUYA,2009-09-25 19:06:10.000,15,False

2,Used to Love It,"I have had a Bazaar subscription for almost five years, and I am really disappointed in the magazine now. I used to read Vogue instead, but stopped because it was all ads and maybe 5 or 6 real articles (more than a page long) and now Bazaar is the same way. I cancelled my subscription a few months ago, but I am still getting issues since it hasn't run out yet (I prepaid). I still flickr through it since I am getting the magazine. In the most recent issue (March 2014) I had to flip through literally a half inch of ads (literally half the magazine) before I finally came to a full page of text. Every single page was an ad, except for the table of contents and the Editor's letter. I looked through the whole magazine and hardly any articles were more than a page long. The fashion articles were barely more than pictures with captions. I feel I deserve more for my money.<br /><br />About a year or so ago they revamped the whole magazine, changing layouts and stuff. I thought that the most dramatic change was going to be the ridiculous circles of text (they were cute at first in only a couple of articles here and there but now it's just annoying) as time goes on I have realized that they are putting more and more ads in the magazine as well.<br /><br />I know ads are how the magazine makes its money. I get that. I'd be fine if they were still putting out good articles with the ads, or at least spacing them out evenly between the ads. But the ads are now taking the place of the articles. What do the writers do all day? They sure as heck aren't creating content for the magazine. Bazaar has bloggers and an Instagram and a Twitter and so on and so forth. Why even read the magazine? You can go look on their website.<br /><br />This magazine is a waste of money.

4,"A few complaints, but overall a really good read","I subscribed to Reader's Digest for a decade while living in Australia, so it was only natural to start up a subscription now I live in the US. I didn't think there would be any real difference in the magazine.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with this periodical. It still contains great stories, feature articles, good pictures and graphics, and the same standard regular contributions such as the humor section &#34;Laughter - the Best Medicine&#34; - all of which I enjoy very much.<br /><br />Unfortunately there are two areas I am disappointed with about this magazine. The first is the number of ads. Not only are there ads sprinkled liberally throughout the digest, but it also comes with several loose ads stuck in between the pages or included in the wrapping. I find this distracting and annoying.<br />The other thing that I have noticed that's different is the quality of the paper used in these Reader's Digest magazines. The paper seems a lot less durable and has a &#34;recycled&#34; feel to it. If that means more trees are saved and the paper is more eco-friendly, then I will support it. But if it is just cost cutting, then I am a bit disappointed in the quality.<br /><br />On a positive note, the digest is also available in digital form, which I find convenient - although I do like to curl up with the magazine in hand and have some quiet time away from the computer to just read :)<br /><br />All up, I do enjoy the content of the Reader's Digest (minus the ads) and I am glad I have a subscription to it so I am ensured of a regular good read!",[],B004GVZUTU,B004GVZUTU,AGCTXL6OVLB4E2NBXCISGTZIIAUQ,2016-02-22 20:50:02.000,5,True

5,"Great mag for history buffs, particularly English history","In the era of Nexus-Kindle-iPad, I'm down to one print magazine subscription: BBC History Magazine.  It's a beautiful magazine that I read cover-to-cover as soon as it arrives in the mail.  It's kind of expensive (about $7 a copy) but well worth it for the amateur historian looking to get exposure to lots of history topics.<br /><br />One thing to make clear up front is that it is very English-focused.  Not British-focused, or Europe-focused, or world-focused.  I'm quite interested in English history, so that works very well for me, but if you're not really into English history, despite the mag's efforts to cover a broad range of world topics, it's probably not going to be of great interest.<br /><br />The other criticism I have is that it's a bit ... fluffy.  Even the feature articles are very short; nothing is ever covered in sufficient depth for a true history enthusiast.  A recent article on women in Anglo-Saxon times barely scratched the surface of the topic, and defaulted to inane politically-correct themes instead of really digging in to that fascinating subject. The mag's coverage of the Richard III skeleton discovery and its implications was brief and feeble.  On the other hand, the brief articles do at least pique your interest and give you things to go read more about and research on the web. And maybe lack of depth is an unfair criticism of a monthly magazine; it is, after all, not a quarterly academic journal.  The writing is good, and there are lots of cool pictures and graphics to keep things interesting.<br /><br />Despite those criticisms, as noted above, it's actually the only magazine to which I subscribe, and each month I wait for it to get here so I can dig in. I'll give it the five stars, although I wish they would have one or two major articles each month that got double or triple the word-count currently given to the feature stories.",[],B00006LB2B,B00006LB2B,AFQRZYOPFMMTMYIVVWYPST7UGSSQ,2013-04-16 03:56:32.000,42,True

The content is geared perfectly for my 5 year old daughter.  She gets excited every time a new issue arrives and reads it cover to cover within a couple of days.  Each issue follows a standard recipe of readings, puzzles and activities.  They even have a Spanglish story each month that introduces a few key words in Spanish.  After my older daughter is done, it gets handed down to the two year old.  I'm not sure if she only likes it because she's copying her sister, but she seems to enjoy all of the pictures and loves writing all over it.

I'm hoping it's that, the only other reason you'd deliberately spread false information would be pretty malicious.<br /><br />Overall a pass if you're looking for anything other than entertainment.  Their ""reviews"" always heavily favor their higher end advertisers, the actual articles are pretty hit or miss when it comes to actual information, and their inability to figure out how to use a scale makes most of their recipes a crapshoot.<br /><br />Wouldn't buy and I'd wish people wouldn't assume it's a great magazine for those involved in homesteading/gardening/etc.",[],B00007AZRH,B00007AZRH,AEWI3NZCHCKQJPIASXEV4VWTXFTQ,2012-01-01 22:40:08.000,14,False

1,Too many ads and too elementary,"I've been writing code for 10 years professionally, as a full stack software engineer. I've had associate, senior, and lead titles. When I saw a coding magazine, I was beside myself with curiosity and excitement. Two months later my first issue has arrived. Let us dig in.<br /><br />The cover of the magazine is very inviting. Lots of popular frameworks, languages, and technologies are listed in the banner and footer. Good colors.<br /><br />When we open the magazine, the first page is a full page advertisement. I skip through and count roughly 5 more. There are only 74 pages in the magazine. Additional advertising is sprinkled throughout the remaining pages. There is even a column on who to reach about ad purchasing.<br /><br />Back on topic, the page quality is very good, my hat is off to whoever chose the paper. Fantastic quality.<br /><br />First content page is an editorial biography. Next we're getting into the actual articles. I'm familiar with about 70% of the content already, and have at least heard of the remainder(through coworkers, other teams, colleagues, etc).<br /><br />The mini-bios of the engineers who wrote the articles lead me to think im about to be taught by a master. I don't recognize their names, but their work in pluralsight, oreily, AWS, microsoft, etc gives me great expectations.<br /><br />And that is where this review goes south, each article is just way too elementary. Some are basically modified versions of 'getting started' tutorial from websites. Albeit some of the tips are indeed great for newbies.

5,"Great articles, great recipes.","I've always liked this magazine. Its articles about food culture and about how food works with societies, families, and customs really speak to an age where those things have been divorced from eating for many years. I learn something new and amazing every time. Sometimes the articles are about American food culture; sometimes they're about foreign food culture; every time, the articles highlight some commonality that binds all of us through what we eat. I've tried several of the recipes and haven't ever been disappointed, either. This is going to sound wonky, but I even like the ads--they talk about foods I'd never heard of before and ways of preparing existing products I hadn't ever thought of trying.<br /><br />The magazine assumes that readers have a fair-to-middling amount of cooking skills as well as a fair-to-middling outfitted kitchen. Recipes range from vegetarian to full-bore carnivorous. They don't generally include nutritional data or cooking times, but are traditionally-formatted (with proper measurements and yields). My main quibble with the recipes is that you really need to read them--they don't normally list things like water in the ingredients, but when you read the directions, you'll notice they call for things not in the ingredient list sometimes. So just pay attention, that's all.<br /><br />Gorgeous photography, great ideas, fascinating articles... this is definitely one of the better cooking magazines out there.",[],B002CT51A6,B002CT51A6,AGJ6IDY4F4OS2VCNDMHJFFM3SYQA,2013-11-01 17:03:28.000,8,True
5,Trustworthy recipes that really work and reviews that are honest.,"In an age when any schmuck celebrity with perfect teeth can put out a goofy themed cookbook, there are very few breaths of fresh air, very few publications that a novice can trust to help get a good meal on the table. As Julia Child discovered many years ago when she was first learning to cook, most cookbooks are awful! And the situation's only gotten worse in our modern age of celebrity ""chefs"" with no training, no understanding of the science in cooking, and absolutely no appreciation for good food.<br /><br />That's why we need this magazine. Cook's Illustrated (and its Best Recipe books and ""Cook's Country"" super-newbie heritage-food magazine) has been one of my Bibles of cooking ever since I was in college. The articles are fascinating and educational; the recipes are straightforward and generally easy to make; the reviews are rock-solid and reliable. I love reading about how the writers went about finding the perfect recipe for whatever it is they're trying to make. Best of all, the recipes rarely require exotic equipment or ingredients. A decently tricked-out kitchen with knives, a blender, and appropriate pots and pans will manage most of these; a food processor is nice, but you can skate by without. Though the magazine expects you to be able to do the basic stuff like whisk or slice raw vegetables, it provides illustrations for anything that might be less-well-known.<br /><br />Best of all, this magazine is one that has not suffered ""mission drift"" over the years. It's never taken advertisements, and it completely lacks the ""lifestyle"" idiocy that plagues just about every one of the other cooking magazines on the market. CI knows that if I wanted to read about yoga or makeup, I'd go read one of those ""women's magazines."" I want to learn about cooking, so they give me nothing but articles about cooking. Yay!<br /><br />If you need a cooking magazine that will help you learn and grow in skill, this is a good one.<br /><br />(PS: I've had subscriptions off and on for about a decade and haven't had any trouble with junk mail. I did have a direct marketer call about a cookbook, but declined and haven't heard anything in the year since.)",[],B002PXW0M6,B002PXW0M6,AGJ6IDY4F4OS2VCNDMHJFFM3SYQA,2012-08-14 22:58:02.000,2,False

Now, it is no better than a 30 minute Rachel Ray show.

Now, it is cluttered and might as well have a feed running across the bottom.<br /><br />Instead of it being a magazine for people who love to truly embrace the culinary arts, it has become just another magazine about food.

3,The only magazine for writers,"The is the only magazine that treats writing as a career and a passion as opposed to a hobby. It's important, useful, and consistently interesting. The short articles on the ins and outs of writing (and what trips people up in pursuit of publication) are always useful, and their calendar is accurate, thorough, and detailed. In some issues they've covered controversies pertaining to different contests and publishing companies, and this is really vital. With so many literary magazines, contests, and publishers, anything that can help you weed out the bad ones is a tremendous asset.<br /><br />Here's the downside: I've been following this magazine for over ten years, and I no longer buy it. Why? They produce the same issues over and over (and over) again. Every year has an MFA issue, a small publishers issue, a literary agent issue. It's tiring. The MFA issue in particular is about as useless as my MFA degree. It's become a formula, and I really, REALLY want them to change it up to address the modern publishing world, and all the ways it is rapidly changing -- from epublishing, to self publishing, to maintaining a strong online presence.

This latest addition talked about who owns the rain and water catchment laws in America, CAFO laws, GMO-Free rights and how European countries are fighting the push from large corporations like Monsanto, to use GMO seeds.<br /><br />Industrial AG Watch; news from the other side of agriculture - very interesting and useful information.<br /><br />Organic News: talks about political appointments, organic trends across America and the world, and other studies.  There are always a couple interesting articles about organic corporations who have lied or gotten fined for not being completely organic.<br /><br />Transitions; Thoughts on Organic Food and Farming<br /><br />And from there the editorial staff concentrates on different issues.<br /><br />There are always important and interesting articles on pasture management and heard nutrition, last month there was an interview about the dairy industry and milk prices, weeds and soil nutrition, they have a brilliant writer, Kinsey, who writes about soil and answers a question every month.<br /><br />February had an extremely informative chicken issue, this September 2009 has articles on fungus and fungus treatment, being that Late Blight is a big topic this wet year in the North East.<br /><br />There are articles on different livestock every month like this month they have an article on Whey-Fed Pigs, sometimes they concentrate on certain heirloom breeds or common farm breeds.<br /><br />Many of the articles are written by different farmers who have made detailed studies and they are very hands-on and helpful even though many of these farmers are not in the North East, but in Missouri and other big farming areas the information I still find pertinent.<br /><br />Other good sections are the Eco-Gardener, The Harvest table; honoring food from farm to fork - this month talking about making your own butter, The Natural Vet, Health & Healing - this month is about genetically engineered crops being in our food chain, and Health & Healing News updates studies like a Folate vs Cancer study, Books and Information, The Last Word, View from the Country and the Classifieds.<br /><br />This is a terrific magazine if you are interested in gardening, farming, self sustainability, animal husbandry and organic living.<br /><br />October 2009 update: I'm still loving Acres and reading 99% of each monthly magazine - really my most fav read!",[],B000EGD2T6,B000EGD2T6,AHBHJ5EMWNZFEJNTYL6MCGAS2P4Q,2009-08-27 11:49:51.000,33,False
5,the whole news and it's funny,"I have been receiving and reading the Economist for so many years that I never considered writing a review for it.  I feel like I am getting extremely well rounded news about the entire world and it helps me live with perspective.  When a new one first arrives I first page through the entire thing and look at the funny photos and very funny headlines - a favorite is ""A nasty Brown mess"" - there are so many!  I imagine a board room of people looking through photos and making up the funniest lines they can think of and they are really great. It is extremely well written, each part of the world is covered, the book reviews are terrific, and in the back, every month, they have the absolute best obituaries on unusual interesting people, many of whom I have never heard of.",[],B00077B7M6,B00077B7M6,AHBHJ5EMWNZFEJNTYL6MCGAS2P4Q,2009-08-08 17:54:23.000,1,False
4,"Foreign food, travel and international recipes","I bought this magazine several times at the store and then decided to buy a subscription.  I mailed my subscription check in mid-late-December and I had already bought the November and December magazines in the store; they promptly sent me November and December and I am waiting to see when they cancel my subscription ...<br /><br />If you like to travel this magazine is really for you, if you are like me and like to stay home and cook there is probably one recipe each issue that I am interested in.  There was a wonderful spatzle recipe and terrific canapes, a simple ""real alfredo"" but being that I live in rural America, many of their recipes don't use ingredients that I can readily buy and I am probably not going to, or at least have not, ordered away for ingredients that I might try using once, although they do have vendors who sell unusual ingredients listed.  I do appreciate interesting ideas for our family gatherings such as in the November 2008 issue they had recipes from Laos and had a recipe for a custard baked in a squash; I will try that this fall when I have so much winter squash I will be looking  for new interesting ways to use them ...<br /><br />One last bit that I like is the lay out of the magazine, they list all the recipes in the front and then in the back they list all the unusual ingredients and vendors in the ""Pantry"" and then they list the recipes again by category; that is nice when your preparing for a family gathering and you are in charge of appetizers or side dishes and you can just breeze through the back issues and find the recipes people might enjoy.<br /><br />I started writing this feeling cool on Saveur but I realize there is more in it than I might be appreciating.<br /><br />I did contact the magazine company and they did agree that they received my check in mid-December and that they sent me November and December after that. I explained that I had already bought those issues, and they agreed to give me 3 more months; I hate doing that because I know all paper businesses are hurting with readership down and the economy in the state that it is ... but I felt I needed to, to be satisfied with my subscription.<br /><br />October 2009 update: I had called them a couple months ago, they agreed to give me a full subscription, rather than counting the back-dated months that they sent upon arrival of my mid-December check; since then I did not receive October's issue and I received November's issue as a ""gift"" since they said my subscription ran out - I am too fed up to deal with them again and they have lost a customer.

They are clearly intended to persuade and that is not the role of science.  So, mostly what I have Discovered is another tool of the demagogues.  The best way to hide a lie is to surround it with truths.  There is so much of this in today's media that passes for science and journalism that few people even notice any more.<br />Still, I have used the magazine to help my kids become more critical thinkers and seperate fact from opinion, so I guess it's not a complete loss.

1,Not What It Used To Be,"I now reminisce about the days when Reminisce was my absolute favorite magazine. I was a subscriber right from the beginning. In fact it is the only one I repeatedly and eagerly re-subscribed to. But after the death of dear Clancy Strock, the editing and format of Reminisce changed dramatically and for the worse. I remember the first time I noticed it. I was paging through the issue in disbelief. Gone were the colorful and chock-full pages of cleverly written reader stories, tidbits, poems and whatnot. Instead, I found wasteful double-page spreads of a single enlarged photo. And dozens upon dozens of stock celebrity photos. Huh??

5,Favorite cooking magazine,"Heck, at the moment it's my favorite magazine of any genre!  I really like the way the magazine is laid out - they have multiple sections for different types of cooking.  Most notably, to me, they have a Weeknight Cooking section and a Weekend Cooking section.  It should be fairly obvious, but the recipes in the weeknight cooking section are pretty fast and simple, and generally fairly inexpensive to prepare, whereas the weekend cooking recipes are a bit more involved/expensive/suitable for company.  This magazine is great for people who like to cook different types of food.  They not only include recipes inspired from around the world but have a nice balance of healthy/indulgent and fast/extravagant in the magazine.  Basically the magazine's got a little bit of everything, which I think is great because you can get everything in one location.  AND the recipes are great - one thing food network chefs are good at is creating recipes that actually have taste.<br /><br />Some other reviews complain about there not being a great number of recipes in each issue - they seem to average between 120 and 125 recipes each.  Since you get a new issue every month (or two), I can't help but wonder how many those people think they need from one source to get them through the month.  Personally I like the balance between recipes and other food-related content, and I got some great ideas for presents for Father's Day!",[],B001LJGVM0,B001LJGVM0,AHOJEG62BO7GPP42IMTMQ5JCY7NQ,2010-05-11 16:55:17.000,0,False

1,The Magazine is Apparently Defunct,"I've been a subscriber for years (and have all issues), and have been a huge fan during that time.  Apparently, though, the magazine is defunct, although Lapham's is still sending out bills and the website is still encouraging subscriptions.  I have several friends who are also subscribers, and none of us have received anything since the Spring issue (we're missing Summer and Fall 2021).  I've tried calling their actual office in D.C. and their subscription service, I've tried e-mail customer service, and I've tried contacting them via social media, all with no luck.<br /><br />This is pretty disappointing for a magazine that I held in very high esteem.  A reputable organization would at least let subscribers know the story, rather than continuing to promote the publication as if everything is going normally.<br /><br />++ UPDATE 24 August 2022<br />As stated above, Lapham's is still selling subscriptions, although subscribers have only received three issues since 2020 (two in 2021, one in 2020).  The website explained that this is due to COVID, but Lapham's is (oddly enough) the only journal publisher to be experiencing such a dramatic situation.  Early this year subscribers were told that they'd be receiving 5 issues in 2022 (to make up for the issues missed in 2021), but going into September 2022, only one has been shipped.  The website says that ""Our June / July issue, Education, is behind schedule"", with no prediction regarding when the issue might be available.<br /><br />So fine, if there is actually a problem with supplies (that is only affecting Lapham's), just let subscribers know that there's no telling when the journal will begin publishing again.  If supply chain issue are not the reason for the virtual shut-down of the periodical, let subscribers know that.

2,"Very little value to me, based on the first 2 issues I have received","I’m just an amateur (couple of years shooting) so I expected more information would be applicable, but I was disappointed to see that most of the articles were either shills for the advertisers or simple, beginning ideas. The “prize-winning” photos were less than amateurish; like the judges had little to chose from. The magazine is so thin it takes only 10-15 minutes to read/scan the whole thing. I’d be embarrassed to publish this.<br /><br />The subscription was cheap at $5/yr so I won’t be canceling on the off chance that something of value will sneak through the editor. Oddly enough they sent two issues at the same time, one of which was the outdated issue from the previous month. I wonder if that was a bonus or if it counted as my first issue.

5,"A bit glossy and ""staged"", but info and tips are great!","My ONLY gripe with this magazine is that the pictures are like those you would find in GQ magazine: they hire models to show you driving a nail or shoveling dirt for that new patio.  These people use only brand new tools (brand name label showing of course) in a perfect-world dust free environment.  The pictures make it look like it's a Sears catalogue.<br /><br />Aside from that, the articles are great making it one of the best magazines for the do-it-yourselfer.  I have saved more money from the tips in this magazine than any other magazine I subscribe to.  Most articles can be done by any semi-skilled craftsman with access to a decent set of tools, making it an approachable magazine for the DIY'er.<br /><br />I highly recedommend this magazine in conjunction with Fine Homebuilding magazine.

The articles in Handyman are a bit more down-to-Earth, but together you will get the most benefit.",[],B00005N7Q1,B00005N7Q1,AFP3XJSQU3FGGBB2F5JFNZPJ7MHQ,2005-08-22 04:08:08.000,71,False

Each month you will find:<br /><br />Safety tips<br /><br />Q&A<br /><br />Finishing Touches<br /><br />Testing power tools<br /><br />Product comparison<br /><br />Building skills<br /><br />Replacing the old (doors, windows, decks...)<br /><br />It seems that every month there is at least one article that is beyond the scope of most subscribers.  But I have found this the most useful, thus far.  A couple of these articles have helped me view / approach a project from a different angle, and each with a far better result than my initial design.  While most of us may not be able to DO all of the incredible things shown in the magazine, we can take away some great ideas and techniques that we can use in other projects.<br /><br />The best thing is that two articles have already saved me more money than the one-year subscription cost me!<br /><br />I highly recommend this magazine in conjunction with Handyman magazine.

5,One of the Best Magazines!,"Ok- I drool the entire time I look at this magazine!  The photos are fantastic, and so inspiring!<br /><br />The recipes seem much more realistic than what they do on t.v.  I also love the fact that the magazine makes the chefs seem more personal, and it makes you want to watch their shows.  I also love their suggestions for kitchen products.  Most are reasonably priced and can be found locally (Kohls carries their entire kitchen line, love it!), rather than some elite boutique in a remote city.<br /><br />Every magazine has a little insert with 50 different suggestions for a certain item.  Last month it was for spaghetti sauce.  I never thought to use such a simple ingredient for so many things!  It really makes you look at everyday items in new and creative ways.  Plus, it comes out easily from the magazine and you just stick it in your recipe book for your next party!<br /><br />If you are looking for a change of pace from the boring cooking magazines, I really recommend this one!

1,Horrible experience,"This magazine was offered as a $5 deal and I was disappointed in the magazine itself.  I did not want to renew, but especially did not want to renew for the pricy renewal fee.

I have called several times already trying to let them know I do not want this magazine anymore and cannot get through to anyone.  I am so disappointed with this.

5,True stories about encounters with angels,"Some anonymous person left three issues of this magazine in the chiropractor's office, where my wife started reading and then asked if she could have them.  Sure, said the receptionist.  Thus were we introduced to a very inspirational magazine.  Who knows?  Maybe it was angel-guided.  We like this magazine enough to subscribe -- which is what brought me here to do this review.<br /><br />&quot;Angels on Earth&quot; is published six times a year by Guideposts, which many people know through the &quot;Guideposts&quot; magazine (inspirational) and holiday theme books.  Although Guideposts is definitely a Christian publisher, the &quot;Angels&quot; magazine itself is non-denominational and even inter-religious at times.  One of the three issues we found in the doctor's office had a story about a Jewish Holocaust survivor.  Another story was about a child looking for a lost cat, with no real focus on God as such, other than being &quot;guided&quot; to look in an unlikely place.  Some of the people in the stories aren't all that religious or, if they are, their particular religion is presented as a part of their personal bio as it fits into the story, not as preaching or &quot;witnessing.&quot;<br />The illustrations, too vary widely -- from &quot;church Sunday school&quot; pictures of angels from the Renaissance Masters, to more ordiinary drawings of sea captains, cops, lumberjacks, ordinary moms and dads  -- depending on the story they illustrate. (If you know &quot;Guideposts&quot;, you know the artwork -- otherwise, think &quot;Reader's Digest.&quot;)<br />The purpose of the magazine is not to convert you to anything but, rather, to tell true stories about people who have had encounters with guardian angels.  &quot;Belief&quot; is left up to the reader.  Some of the angel stories are of the &quot;miracle&quot; type: surviving car crashes, shipwrecks, serious illnesses, etc.  Others are of the more &quot;ordinary&quot; type, such as the stranger who is there at the right moment.  This fits with the Jewish POV of an angel, since the Hebrew word, malach, can refer either to a supernatural being or an earthly messenger.<br />Personally, I believe in angels, and I find the stories fascinating.  Granted, some of them might strike you as versions of &quot;The Vanishing Hitchhiker.&quot;  On the other hand, all the stories are first-person, by-lined accounts, often with photos of the people or animals involved.  And how do we know the Vanishing Hitchhiker isn't a real angel sometimes?",[],B00005QDWH,B00005QDWH,AEXFZ74MQFAH4YH2CZ37EZ6PC2UQ,2001-12-17 19:53:52.000,168,False

3,Magazine is not what it used to be,"I ordered this magazine for my boyfriend and his first complaint was that the magazine was practicly all advertisement and hardly anything actually readable in the whole thing.

I used to get this magazine about 6 years ago and I remember it being thicker and having more interesting stuff in it. I'm not too disapointed though because after all I did get it at a highly discounted price of $5.00 for a year subscription and to me, that's one and a half issues off the stands at the store so I'm really not upset I spent my money on it.

5,Best Knitting Magazine on the Market,"Vogue Knitting International is in my opinion the best knitting magazine on the Market. It's not too far out there with strange designs, but you get a good mixture of quality knitwear designs.

4,Compromisingly Unique,"Saveur got a new Editor-in-Chief in 2006, when Colman Andrews (one of the original founding crew from the magazine's inception) stepped down after long-running battles with the new corporate ownership (World Publications out of Winter Park Florida.) Andrews was a curmudgeon, and a brilliant iconoclast.  For years, he refused to run an image of a turkey on the cover of the November issue, to the displeasure of the newsstand sales dept. He was replaced by James Oseland, a contributor and Associate Editor at the magazine (one of his first acts was to run a picture of a turkey on the cover of the November issue - get it?) Saveur has fallen on tough times. Since most ad budgets for the food category are gobbled up by Rachel Ray, Gourmet, BonAppetit, Food and Wine and the like, Saveur is left with table scraps, and issues are skinny. Photography and art direction have always been first rate, and Oseland builds on this tradition with his passion for food photos that border on pornography, they are so luscious) But a shift in focus from Andrews' euro-centric vision to Oseland's more pan-asian outlook (he is the author of an excellent book on Indonesian cuisine, ""Spice Islands"") leaves something in translation as these themes don't resonate as heartily with Saveur's core audience.  But he does seem to be attracting some younger, more urban readers. (Somehow, images of sweaty, grimy cooks behind-the-scene in a Bombay restaurant doesn't stir my soul for Indian food, though.) There is one bright spot - a greater focus on Asia has lightened up Saveur's previous artery-clogging fare. The editorial staff write for themselves mainly, so if you share their vision, then you'll love Saveur. (A special issue in 2007 was all about Chicago for instance, which happens to be Oseland's home town.) And other reviewers are spot-on about the recipes - if you don't live in NYC, you'll have trouble handily finding ingredients such as chicken feet, although they do reference websites for you to source things via mail-order. Wine coverage since Andrews left has been improving but still not back to where it should be - Oseland isn't a wine drinker, and wine stories compete for precious editorial space in these lean times for magazine advertising.  I give Saveur high marks for uniqueness.  If you do subscribe, broaden your palette and pair Saveur's mineral, flinty undertones with a more practical, off-dry recipe holder such as Bon Appetit, Southern Living, or even Everyday with Rachel Ray (especially if you are the type that likes to hit the ""Easy"" button!)",[],B00005N7SL,B00005N7SL,AEJGKOYDFLNDKKCNAPZMRDOAL5QA,2009-02-09 22:18:40.000,37,False

3,Only for the wealthy/Tiny print,"I had to cancel my subscription because the articles and reviews focus on products that most cannot afford.

I have been a so-called audiophile for the past 35+ years and have had subscriptions to Stereophile Magazine on and off during that life span. What I noticed is that the equipment that is reviewed is increasingly becoming more exotic and outrageously expensive and that nobody has ever heard of ?  If I did win the Lotto, I would not know where to go to audition this equipment, because it is so exotic.

The book reviews are always informative. I usually end up making the featured recipe and many have been excellent. German Life is a wonderful magazine for all German Americans interested in their heritage; a real gem.<br /><br />Some of my fellow reviewers complain that the magazine's articles aren't substantive.

3,Brief Critique of Polish American Journal,"The Polish American Journal is published monthly in newspaper format out of Boston, New York near Buffalo. The journal presents news and information regarding Poland and American Polonia from a very conservative, traditionalistic point of view. This is a folksy paper geared towards the Polish American blue hairs who still attend functions down at the struggling Dom Polski so you won't ever find any articles critical of Poland. While one would not expect a Polish American paper to present Poland and Polonia in a negative light, many of the most chauvinistic, parochial attitudes associated with Polish Catholic ethno-nationalism, including a certain degree of anti-Jewish bias, can be found in the pages of the PAJ. The paper advertises that it provides features by ""Polonia's finest academicians and historians"" however subscribers will instead find the paper's actual writers rarely measure up to those credentials. They can, however, usually be counted on to present news and opinion from very conservative and far-right points of view. For example, articles regularly appear in the PAJ in support of hyper-catholic, ultra-nationalistic Radio Maryja, which is so extreme it even rankles the conservative Polish Catholic Church and the Vatican. Letters to the editor asking that the paper present the news in a more moderate, objective voice are ignored.<br /><br />Of course, the Polish American Journal does have its good points. Readers are able to keep current with what's going on down at the Polish embassy and what new polka CD's and books are out. There's also plenty of apolitical features on traditions and holidays. So while I do recommend the PAJ, I caution potential subscribers that they will be getting only a very conservative slant on Polish current events and history.",[],B00006KT2F,B00006KT2F,AEBMSOQLX55ISSFOJT37IYIMIQGQ,2010-03-21 23:56:28.000,10,False
3,Brief Critique of The Sarmatian Review,"The Sarmatian Review is an academic journal published three times per year by the Polish Institute of Houston at Rice University. The dearth of information on Poland in the U.S. makes The Sarmatian Review a must for all serious students of Poland. However, the publication does have its faults. Many of the articles are devoted to topics drier than the Bledow Desert. Also, as one might expect, many of the articles are written in flagrant academese and are barely discernable.<br /><br />Perhaps most disturbing is the journal's decidedly chauvinist, right-wing editorial bent. I've noticed many, many pro-Kaczynski, anti-liberal quips in the Sarmation Review since subscribing in 2006. Of course, this is not surprising to anyone familiar with the Endekian leanings of American Polonia. However, my jaw dropped while reading """"People's Poland"" in the Third Polish Republic"" by Barbara Fedyszak-Radziejowska (April, 2010) in which the author, an obvious Kaczynskiite, compares the centrist Civic Platform Party to the PRL! I have never read such reactionist nonsense in my entire life.<br /><br />While Fedyszak-Radziejowska fumbles for an explanation for PO's popularity among Poland's ""elites"" by making slanderous comparisons to the PZPR, it's extremely easy to understand why the hyper-nationalistic, ultra-catholic, xenophobic, Germanophobic, anti-European, Radio Maryja-endorsed, conspiracy-driven rhetoric of the Kaczynskis and PiS wouldn't appeal to Poland's educated, urban voters.<br /><br />In its defense, the review does run some very interesting articles at times, the data sheet is often entertaining despite a regular right-wing slant on the numbers, and the book reviews are often informative. But as I wrote before, the review is strictly for the serious Polish enthusiast. All others will find it insufferably chauvinistic and boring.<br /><br />Postscript: After receiving the Sarmatian Review for several years I finally allowed my subscription to lapse. The chauvinist right-wing, neo-nationalist editorial bent and boring articles were too much.",[],B00006KW5Y,B00006KW5Y,AEBMSOQLX55ISSFOJT37IYIMIQGQ,2010-03-21 21:36:28.000,1,False

3,Hit or miss,"Let's be honest, the internet has kind of ruined magazines. Every other issue had something I enjoyed. Mostly it felt like a printed blog. The tip of the iceberg maybe, or just something for the coffee table. I'm not trying to be a troll, as I do like the ideas behind much of it and the pictures... I admire the visually stimulating art work that it contains. In addition to the photography I like the drawn adds, those are fun to look over when they appear. It's very comforting to peruse and leaves you content visually. But the meat and potatoes, writing, landed somewhere between Southern/Country Living's Showcase style (""Get to know Lucy and her life as a self funded stay at home parent of 3 dogs, 2 goats, and a sheep in 5 paragraphs and 3 pages of staged pictures, also learn how she refreshed a 100 year old house with paint from behind the barn and a keen design eye that matches what we like"") and weaker articles about collectioning things. It's just that there always seemed to be a lot left out. Our library has a subscription. I'll probably just stick to that unless an issue has something truly riviting, then I would buy just that issue for my reference.

5,Best Magazine Ever!,"I just turned 25 and was looking for a magazine to help me simplify my life, organize my apartment, give me some cooking tips, etc - the stuff you don't learn in college.  This magazine does the job perfectly!  This magazine is chock full of tips to help you save money, time and energy from everything from cooking and cleaning to parenting and hosting a party.  It addresses every day issues (how to stop your sink from dripping) to life issues (secrets to a happy marriage from couples who have been married at least 50 years).  I think it's a must for recent college grads and would be very enjoyable to everyone else!  Let's face it - who couldn't use some tips on how to make their life real simple?!  Some of the products they review can be on the pricier side but they give you cheap alternatives as well, which is great for someone like me!  Buy it for your sister, girlfriend, wife, best friend, mother and/or grandmother - they will not be disappointed!

3,"Some interesting content, but not that great","I like to do a lot of my own work around the house and almost always have a project of some kind in progress. Well this magazine does have some interesting tips and project ideas, most of it is kind of useless and some things are pretty poorly written.<br /><br />An example of a useless article is one that gave all these ""helpful"" tips for around the house. One was to put a lazy susan on your counter and put your olive oil and such on it. Kind of a stupid tip as a lazy susan would look pretty ugly on the counter and would be of dubious value as far as getting to bottles easily especially when you factor in all the wasted counter space compared to just putting the bottles themselves there. A couple pages later another tip, put a lazy susan in your refrigerator... seems like the same crappy tip only it wastes space in the fridge where it's even more precious. This magazine is filled with a lot of things like that and is really geared towards the much older crowd.<br /><br />As I said some of the project ideas aren't bad and some of the product reviews seem somewhat helpful, but I even have a little trouble trusting their expertise in the reviews based on some of the other clueless things that they say.<br /><br />One other thing that kind of bothered me is that they sent me an issue that was supposedly a special extra large issue with a note that it counted as 2 issues from my subscription because it was so  much extra content. This was kind of annoying as I paid for a certain number of issues and they take it on themselves to reduce that amount based on this ""special"" issue that was actually only 20 pages longer then the issue before it. There was something in there saying I could contact them if I didn't agree with it and presumably be credited another issue, but I don't really have the time to waste dealing with a trivial thing like that.

3,At least the new editor is better than the old one,"Currently (as of Feb. 2014), Susan Spencer is the editor. This is a great improvement over Elizabeth Mayhew, who took over as editor for Jane Chesnutt and served in that role from 2010 to 2012. Although I like the new editor much better than Mayhew, this magazine still isn't as compelling as it once was (pre-2010).<br /><br />There are some decorating articles which are always my favorite, as well as lots of recipes, a few health-related articles, at least one article on clothing / outfits, and usually a few life stories (human interest stories). Over all, this article is a quick-read - you can get through the entire magazine in one sitting in about half an hour. I think the target demographic for this magazine might be women ages 35 to 65 years old. For example, there is usually at least one article related to coping with senior parents.<br /><br />While this is not a bad magazine, you may be better served by subscribing to a magazine that more closely matches your specific interests and hobbies.",[],B002V0CJL0,B002V0CJL0,AGG6BKDYWE6N6DPLJJB2WGTUV5UQ,2014-02-24 22:06:18.000,1,True

4,"Love the content, hate the tiny font","I usually enjoy about three of the articles in this magazine, which makes it worth the price of the magazine to me. I find particular enjoyment in the house and organization articles.<br /><br />However, is it just me or is this magazine plainly hard to read on the subway? Its large size and heft make it a little bit of a drag on my shoulder to carry in my purse. Plus, its small font size makes me have to place my face a little too close for comfort to the page in order to read it. I wear contact lenses so I don't have ""bad eyes"". I think I have normal eyes, and yet, this font is uncomfortable to read because of its small font size.<br /><br />In summary, I enjoy this magazine a lot, but prefer House Beautiful for its easy-to-read font size and ease of carrying (not too heavy/bulky). True, I get less content with House Beautiful, but that magazine also costs less on Amazon, which makes up for it in my opinion.",[],B002PXW1IE,B002PXW1IE,AGG6BKDYWE6N6DPLJJB2WGTUV5UQ,2012-12-21 16:46:30.000,1,False

Don't get me wrong - there are still plenty of food recipes in each issue of Country Living. However, it's a nice balance between articles on food, decor, DIY/crafts, flowers, and entertaining.<br /><br />UPDATE: I used to look forward to receiving my issues in the mail. However, the magazine seems to be going in a new direction. One part of that is focusing more on older items, such as expensive vintage items I could never afford to buy. Another part is focusing on rustic items with patina, but to me, the items just look rusty and neglected. Those gruff items are pricey too. I don't want to fill my home with a bunch of nonsense items. That includes the nature-inspired items such as taxidermy. I'm not sure what is going on with this magazine to be honest.

5,Unparalleled Magazine,"In this digital age, I get most of my news information online; I recently cancelled my subscriptions to Newsweek and Time, because they simply don't match the breadth of information I can receive online.  The one print subscription I still maintain -- and will continue to maintain until they rip it from my cold, dead hands! -- is National Geographic.<br /><br />Why is National Geographic a must-have item in my household?  This magazine offers something that no other continues to do: in-depth journalism, coverage of global issues, and stunning photography.  Unlike many magazines, which tried to shorten content to ""digestible"" sizes to appeal to digital readers with short attention spans, National Geographic has done the opposite.  Each issue contains articles that are several pages long, requiring months of research and planning.  The journalists capture, with vivid detail, the experience of being in a particular place at a particular time, reporting objectively but gripping the reader nonetheless.  And, oh, the photography!  From large photographic spreads to smaller, thumbnail-sized frames, each photographic demonstrates sheer artistry.<br /><br />I also love the global scope of National Geographic magazine.  Its content covers history, psychology, evolutionary biology, ecology, anthropology, geopolitics, astronomy, technology, and more.  From an article on an early Antarctic expedition to an in-depth look at the encroachment of oil companies on some of Ecuador's last remaining unspoiled rainforest, National Geographic offers unparalleled breadth and depth of coverage.<br /><br />I could go on, but suffice it to say that I look forward to this magazine's arrival every month.  No matter what your background or areas of interest, National Geographic is sure to have something to capture your imagination.

1,It’s such a mixed bag - but way too bias to be trusted,"One article might be informative and the next 5 with be full of liberal agenda driven absurdities.<br /><br />For example, I quote: “The president laughed off the virus and the Democrats’ response to it, calling it their “new hoax,” which immediately polarized the citizenry’s response to precautionary public-health information.”<br /><br />Well that is just a bare-faced lie. A “fake news” story that had been debunked, and yet they were repeating it with an updated spin.<br /><br />The fact is Democrats were not concerned about the virus at all. They were obsessed with an impotent impeachment game when Trump said no more travel from China, they’re having an epidemic there. Democrats ATTACKED him (because it’s all they do - ad nauseam) for having a hysterical overreaction and being xenophobic! It was their absurd spin as they tried to politicize the virus - Trump was doing too much/he wasn’t doing enough - that he was referring to as their “new hoax.” Clearly meaning the new thing they were trying to bludgeon him with.<br /><br />If anyone’s been paying attention with half a brain cell, or has a modicum of honesty, they could see clearly that the WH has been taking it seriously from the get-go, while not trying to panic people. They’ve been having briefings with experts daily for weeks! If people aren’t taking it seriously it’s because they’ve got their heads up their asses!

5,Maximum PC - Minimum BS,"I started buying this in Sept of '03 because of the short blurb on the cover (of every issue) ""Maximum PC - Minimum BS"".<br /><br />I have never seen that proved wrong.  Every issue is crammed full of articles that bring maximum PC goodness right to your mailbox.<br /><br />There are articles about building and modifying your own PC, reviews of PC's and PC components, a ""Watchdog"" column that keeps readers abreast of problems in the industry (and attempts to find solutions for readers, too - a nice touch), a head-to-head article that compares one similar product to another, an ""Ask the Doctor"" column that provides answers to both simple and very complex computer questions, and many others.<br /><br />My favorite is the how-to's in just about every issue.  All of the how-to's show even neophytes how to get down and get dirty with mods (modifications) to their machine.  But, the articles take neither a ""write down to the lowest level"" nor a ""technogeek know-it-all"" approach - they tell you what to do and how to do it simply, and reveal many ""secrets"" you won't read in mainstream computer magazines.<br /><br />And the reviews.  I love the ""Kick-A**"" award - you know that product is good.  And when a product doesn't meet their standards they simply come right out and tell you it sucks - saving people lots of money in the bargain, I suspect.<br /><br />This product is managed by the same people who do ""PC Gamer"" and it shows.  Many games =require= the latest and greatest machines in order to run well.  And the few game reviews shows that they know games just as well as they know computers.<br /><br />Their writing style isn't for everyone, but I really enjoy the almost in-your-face attitude that they project.  This is the kind of person I want standing behind me when I make expensive modifications to my computer system - keeping me from making mistakes before I start to turn a single screw.<br /><br />Recommended to anyone who has ever thought of opening the cover of their computer and doing thier own upgrades and modifications.  Highly recommended to any person who builds and modifies computers - especially highly recommended to any people who do this for computers that are virtually dedicated to gaming.  Well worth reading and keeping.",[],B00005N7P0,B00005N7P0,AGAHD3ETKJTDC4UZMIHHAEDLNKXQ,2004-11-22 20:57:16.000,9,False

5,"My ""Desert Island"" Magazine","I've been a subscriber to this magazine (and a previous incarnation, Stereo Review) since the early 1990s. It is always enjoyable to read, even after morphing into the audio/video magazine it is today. Print media and magazines are struggling, and to be honest I feel this magazine is a bit &#34;thinner on content and focus&#34; than it has been in the past. Still, this is the one magazine to which I will keep subscribing, even if I cancel the others. The product reviews are a good way to stay informed about new technologies. Interviews with musicians, sound engineers and industry experts are fascinating. There are also occasional features on fancy home theater rooms. My only complaint is I wish the &#34;content&#34; review portion would get more opinionated. Movie reviews describe the image and sound, but in the past they used to also rate the quality of the movie itself. One of the funniest, snarkiest album review quotes I ever read came from this magazine. Can't remember it exactly, but it went something like this:<br /><br />&#34;Barry Gibb's new album was so over produced and tailored to a known audience that one wonders if it was not produced by the artist himself but by a computer at the Harvard business school.&#34;<br /><br />Unfortunately, you won't find reviews like that anymore! The most recent issue (June 2018) mentions the magazine has changed ownership to a parent company in the UK. It will be interesting to see if that changes anything. If they change trajectory, I hope they introduce a little more risk and opinion.",[],B01FV536MC,B01FV536MC,AG3URM4TPWTI45ADF34BCDIUBDVA,2018-05-27 11:20:15.091,1,True

2,"Decent magazine, horrendous company","This will be my last year of this magazine.  It's not a bad magazine, but the company behind it is the most lowdown, dirty, stereotypical ""used car salesman"" style company I have ever dealt with. And that's unfair to the car salesman.<br /><br />Get prepared to make some phone calls.  They've sent me two books, then aggressively tried to charge me for them each time.  Problem is, I didn't order either one.  I didn't use a credit card, but I wouldn't put it past them to make unauthorized charges, so be careful.  Enough verbal threatening over the phone will eventually get them off your case, and they'll just tell you to keep the books.  Believe me, not worth it.<br /><br />And lastly, I'm no longer getting my money's worth.  The price per issue has gotten far too high, and keep in mind each issue is only approx 30 pages.  Pair that with only 6 issues per year, and you're not getting much for your money.  Their equipment reviews are nice, their product comparisons are nice, but the recipes are hit or miss. Far too many tend to focus more on how pretty they look rather than how they taste.  But overall, it just isn't worth the hassle any longer.  Not to mention you'll get inundated with junk mail.<br /><br />Warm up your cross-cut shredder, you're going to need it.  I'm here today because I got a warning that my subscription was about to expire, even though I swore I just extended it a few months ago.  Since there are only 6 issues, they pretty much bombard you with renewal requests right out of the gate.

They are outside the norm and I find that lots of times I can easily alter them to incorporate beads or whatever. I've made a few wearables for friends and family and it's so gratifying to see someone enjoy your work and get to wear a pretty much one-of-a-kind top. Also, crochet tops hide a multitude of ""sins"". I have a friend who has a nice figure but she's had a few children now so is uncomfortable showing her middle. I made her a top from a pattern from this magazine that had tight stitching at the top for modesty but I did a more openwork diamond type of pattern on the bottom that let her skin show through and she wore it lots of times this last summer. I'm working on another for her for next year and will give it to her for her birthday in February.<br /><br />I really enjoy this magazine and hoard the issues to keep coming back to them as time allows.

5,Excellent magazine,"I like CH alot. Excellent seasonal recipes with good techniques made with ingredients available from almost every grocery store. Really good subscriber Q&A and tips and tricks section. Recipes are generally simple, easy to follow, and I have always had great success with every one. Really good flavors and results every time. Nutrition information is given with almost all recipes, great. The themed books are great as well: Light, Grilling, Summer, Holiday..., I think I have every one. Pictures are real, not doctored and give some nice presentation inspiration.<br /><br />One reviewer stated they didn't like the advertisements, I don't get advertisements in mine, not sure what that was about and I've had my subscription expire and I never had any problems like another reviewer.<br /><br />There is a CH website but no database, would live to see that sometime in the future.",[],B002MRSLK0,B002MRSLK0,AFMQR6AL7RNDWMFIOTAEIDUQ7SWA,2012-10-24 14:17:34.000,3,False
2,"Ok, but not 5 stars","I have been a long time CI subscriber both magazine and web. They teach viable, updated techniques for a hoard of main ingredients. I like the publication for its lack of advertisements and honest, no-nonsense character. Background and trial and error information is shared for featured recipes and that makes interesting reading. Every CI recipe I've ever tried is successful to a basic extent. But many, like other recipe sources, lack the results to warrant the titles CI endows on them like ""ultimate"" and ""Best ever"". About half the recipes are simply lackluster. Most of the recipes have no consideration for nutrition and all lack nutrition information.<br /><br />I agree with all the critical reviews here concerning the tactics of the publisher. Most disturbing is my latest subscription debacle. According to CI I had ""auto subscribed"", but after checking (yes I kept the paperwork) I had not. They didn't send me any reminders, nor did they have my credit card information to just bill me. Instead, after sending me 2 issues beyond the expiration date of the old subscription, they sent me overdue notices. I called the customer service and told the rep how disappointed I was that the publisher uses these tactics. They agreed to cancel immediately (of course) and that is that, I'll never subscribe to CI again, it's just not acceptable to try to trick your way into continued business.<br /><br />The website is really convenient and I do maintain that subscription for now. Like other reviewers stated, you still don't get access to ""Editors Pics"", the so called best of the best. Another shady tactic to bilk more money from you.<br /><br />To CI: What's more important (and profitable), Keeping lifelong customers through a good magazine (which it is) and honest business practices or constantly trying to scam your way into more subscriptions? Why don't you put that in the test kitchen and see how it bakes up?",[],B000069YW9,B000069YW9,AFMQR6AL7RNDWMFIOTAEIDUQ7SWA,2011-11-27 17:52:43.000,10,False

5,"The definitive Dr. Who magazine in a convenient, if pricey AMAZON package","It's a glossy high quality mag. done for fans by fans. Cover to cover it's 66 pages of interesting stuff about 41 years of Doctor Who. Doctor Who Monthly is loaded with original color photo spreads and articles about the TV show, new and old. It covers related books, DVDs, CDs, appearances, conventions, merchandize, and more. DWM has insightful interviews with series stars past, present and future. The new series' producer Russel T. Davies, as a fan, gives exclusive info and interviews to the magazine, out of respect and thanks for all the years he enjoys DWM before working on the series. Learn TORCHWOOD spin-off info here first, which books, toys and DVDs are due out and reviews for them in OFF THE SHELF. Read set reports from the episodes in production and post-production.

DWM is published by MARVEL COMIC UK so there is always a 4 or 6 part comic strip, currently featuring the 10th Doctor and Rose.<br /><br />If love the series this is the best publication on the market related to the series, although DreamWatch is easier to find at a Barnes and Nobles, but you might get only one Dr. Who article in it. DWM runs about $7.99 cover (apart from AMAZON), publishing 13 magazines per year (there's an ANNUAL special), you can special order issues without a subscription at some bookstores or most comicbook shops.

5,An Excellent Magazine With or/ Without The Disk...,"The PS2 has sold over 30 million units (or so) as of late....<br />The XBOX has sold close to 11 million units as of late...<br />Q: Yet do you know which magazine (official PS2 or XBOX magazine) has more subscribers?<br />A: Official XBOX Magazine (OXM) does, with over 400,000 subscribers.<br />Q: Do you know why so many people subscribe to this magazine?<br />A: Because it has excellent reviews, great articles, fair- unbiased opinions about all systems, up-to-date news, and accurate rumors about what to expect in the near future...<br />Here's what I thought of OXM, the OFFICIAL XBOX Magazine, after a 12-week subscribtion....<br />1) The columns: First off, these magazines are PACKED with information about not only the XBOX (mostly), but just gaming in general...  Interviews, reviews, previews, rumors, specials, tips, etc...  Its all here, all about XBOX.  We recently found out (officially) that Grand Theft Auto and GTA: Vice City are coming out for the XBOX...<br />If your read OXM a few months ago, GTA was reported to be coming to XBOX in a 2-game package...<br />Months before HALO 2 was announced for the XBOX, OXM predicted informed us of it in an earlier issue...<br />I was low on cash, and didn't have the money to rent a lot of games that &quot;looked&quot; good.<br />Weeks later, I noticed that the games that I bought and were reccomended by OXM were great, and the ones I tried that OXM dismissed...were average to bad games, and were not worth my cash...<br />My point in all this is that this magazine is full of people who know what they're talking about.  Experienced gamers who have accurate sources, and get the info out to us, is what OXM is all about.  They have accurate ratings on games, know their rumors, and really get you excited about not just XBOX, but gaming in general, as they tell you about some of the things they get to experience, sometiems YEARS before people like us will see them.<br />Creative, fun, and accurate (and with a good sense of humor), OXM is a great magazine, and definantly worth my fifteen dollars...<br />2) Reviews/Previews: This magazine reviews 30-40 games a week, and previews at least 10 games.  ANd the reviews are for the most part accurate and well done.  Most reviews have 7-8 articles of real info, real opinions, and real descriptions of the game.  If you can't rent it, this is the next best thing.  They gave HALO-Splinter Cell-DOA3 all 9.0-10 scores, and they were all fantastic games.  Other games like NFL Blitz 2003, Obi-wan, and Crash Bandicoot, they gave lower scores of 6-8.5, which I agreed with as well.<br />These guys know what they're doing, and actually play these games thoroughly before writing the reviews.<br />As for the previews, we were hearing information about Splinter Cell, DOA: Xtreme Beach Volleyball, Amped 2, and Project Gotham Racing 2 months before they hit the shelves...<br />These guys (and girls) play these anticipated games, or at least early demos of the game, months before they're released, and get the information out so you can start saving up.  An excellent magazine, OXM has prepared me and steered me away from a number of games, and just keeps on doing it...<br />3) Interviews: Almost every issue of this magazine has interesting interviews with makers of dozens of games.  They talked with Ubi-Soft about Splinter Cell, RARE about being bought and joining the XBOX team, Bungie when they announced HALO 2, Microsoft XBOX employees about the future of XBOX and current plans...  They got the scoop on XBOX Live almost immediatly after the XBOX was released...( months before it came out)  These guys are weaved into the gaming world, and give people like me abd u a little bit of where gaming is headed, and of what's to come...<br />4) Hints and Tips: Another thing this magazine has is a ton of great hints and tips.  Beleive it or not, the people who write about and give us the scoop on all these great games coming to XBOX, are also gamers themselves...and they are good ones too!  And every issue, they give you step-by-step tips to dozens of great games.  In the past, they've helped us with LOTR: Two Towers, Splinter Cell, HALO, BMX XXX, etc...  When you hit a wall in a game, OXM just might be the ones to bring that wall down...<br />5) Opinions: This magazine, last but not least, is full of great opinions from not only xpert gamers and XBOX fans like these writers.  But every issue has letters sent to OXM, with XBOX gamers asking questions or stating opinions, and OXM responding to them.  Curious about what fellow XBOX gamers are thinking about?  This magazine brings your dozens of opinions every week...  Very interesting read!<br />Overall, this magazine is just incredible.  When comparing it to other magazines, OXM just has a style to it that others lack.  With it's accurate info, great articles, in depth hints, and just love of gaming, OXM is a winner, and for fifteen bucks, a must have for any XBOX gamer...<br />Oh, and if your wondering if I'll be renewing my subscribtion (mine ends next month), the answer is a definate yes.<br />Thx!<br />obryanstars*",[],B00005QDWQ,B00005QDWQ,AFS3M5PCHD4BWHG5LLUKMIJZNMKA,2003-10-19 03:16:24.000,11,False

There are many different sections, and they are all inspirational yet practical. The beauty handbook offers tips such as how to get a certain look for less money. The health section explains, in plain English, various studies, health information, and recent developments. The fitness section offers easy-to-do, relatively short and simple workouts that are effective. The nutrition part gives readers easy, tasty, and healthy recipes to follow.<br />Unlike many magazines, SELF is not depressing to read.

While the articles in Stuff are interesting, they're slightly sub-par compared to Maxim. Stuff feels like the leftovers that didn't quite make it into Maxim. However, the girls are just as beautiful, and the magazine has one monthly feature that Maxim missed, Dawn's Column, where she interviews a group of everyday (but still beautiful) women who reveal all kinds of valuable tidbits for guys.

3,A haven for Democrats!,"A lot of this magazine is very good.  There are some smart articles in here, and some fun reads.  But to often if the writer or editor is able to pop a political message or bent into an article they will do so.  I don't mind this every so often, but there is a definite heavy bias to the left in this magazine without any counter balance.  I guess it would be the equal of having a liberal watch Fox News all day.  I first really noticed this with their supposed unbiased ""election guide"", it was any thing but laughably biased.  You could tell it was written by a team that was heavily fans of Obama.  It was mostly factual, but doesn't tell the whole truth if you catch my drift.<br /><br />Then lately they have been parading excellent but heavily leftist folk through the covers, (Bill Clinton, Sean Penn, Tina Fey, George Clooney) Nothing in and of itself wrong with those people, but the sum effect between the people they focus on and the article bias; is that if you have views right of center, you are often left out in the cold or ridiculed.  Despite the common leftist bias of magazines, news, television and other media this magazine is a little more in that direction.  I am open minded, but would like a little less politics in such a magazine, and if you are going to go there, even it out occasionally or own up to it!<br /><br />I would think their staff is so heavily leftist that they can even see where they are at.  It is still otherwise a fine magazine, better than most, but your going to enjoy this magazine a whole lot better if you voted for Obama.<br /><br />In the end the political stuff wore on me, and some of the lightly lingerie clad gals who are beautiful gracing the cover, keep it from being coffee table fodder at my family home.

5,Cooking for the scientific-minded...,"While I am not professionally trained, I have attended many advanced cooking classes over the years and have built up a fairly decent repertoire of skills. I am proud to say I receive consistent praise for my platings and have been asked to demonstrate techniques or help out at parties. My wife loves to boast about her ""live-in-chef"". (She just told me to put that in) ;) If you are someone like me or an aspiring enthusiast and would like to understand why food prepared with the same ingredients but with different technique will taste different, this is the magazine for you.<br />  Additionally, the product comparisons have, I my opinion, have been spot on. Yes, other magazines feature products but none of the others really test and compare them against each other for fear of insulting their advertisers. Which brings up a another point: The reason the other magazines cost less is because their budget is subsidized by advertising.<br />  If you want lots of enticing pictures, mountains of advertising, recipes with little background or technique and want to save 8 dollars a year you could buy a different magazine and probably be happy with it.  If you really want to be a better cook, buy Cook's Illustrated.",[],B000069YW9,B000069YW9,AFLILLIQVORS7MAW7V632I4FPFGQ,2007-10-19 07:59:21.000,0,False

Why hide your opinions?<br />The magazine promotes lessening or eliminating corporate taxes and not raising tax rates on the rich, while promoting government-paid: training programs based on what local employers want, cash assistance for employees who move over two hours from a new job, intensive home visits with health and nutrition care for children younger than preschool, expanded preschool, and earned income credits contingent on work so as to discourage poor people from not having paid employment (instead of taking care of their own young children).

The declining middle class?<br />Their promotion of unhealthy homosexual &#34;marriages&#34; and applause at the &#34;gentle&#34; decline of worldwide fertility rates from 6 children per woman in 1960 to about 2 children per woman indicates their population control agenda and distorted sexual viewpoint.

5,Great little scan of the sciences,"Good quick scan of what's new in the sciences. I've subscribed for over 10 years  It use to be a 16 page weekly that had short concise pithy summaries of the latest news in science with reference to original source. It was clearly the best summary for busy folk or those just preferring a quick titillating overview. In recent years they switched to  a 32 page format every two weeks. At the same time the article quality seemed slip a bit getting more verbose and longer. The genre of the adds also changed. I'm guessing in response to economic pressures. In frustration, I looked for a replacement, but Science News is still the best broad field science overview I have found including science blogs available via Kindle. Most articles are still short at a paragraph or two to half a page with one or two longer feature articles. Relevant color photo graphs are also included. If you are at all interested, it is worth a try. I find articles that relate to work (Medical device R&D), that my wife, kids, friends and I discuss, and that relate to various books I'm reading.

3,Lame Magazine without the Disc,"I can't say I really like OXM or look forward to it's arrival every month.  The writing is rather bland and boring, despite their attempts at humor.  (Editor-in-Chief is Mike Salmon, former editor of the late great PCXL magazine, but his insanity has been tamed for this mass-marget publication.)  I like reading trying to pick out the actual facts from the fluff in their previews - it's pretty thin!  You'll find juicy info on Microsoft games and close allies like Ubisoft, but otherwise there's not much goodness here.  The screenshots are usually so-so and low in number, and the copy is printed in such large size I feel like I'm reading a kid's book. The magazine is thin enough as it is.<br />The demo disk is the main draw of the magazine, and since the Xbox still isn't as big as PS2, there are a few months when the demos are rather sparce.  To be fair, though, sometimes the offical PS magazine has a lame demo disk, too.  They make good use of the Xbox hard drive, though, with plenty of great downloads each month - maps, missions, uber-saves, cheats, etc.  One major rip-off is that they don't give subscribers the plastic thinpack DVD covers, but instead a boring old cardboard cover.  You have to pay $20 extra to get the plastic covers, driving the cost to almost $40!  Don't get this mag without the demo disk.

CANSLIM has a strict set of rules, starting with finding stocks with good fundamentals, then ""buying right"", then selling right.  In the beginning, I found it VERY difficult to follow the rules.  Human nature is emotional and I found myself holding a stock waiting for a comeback after it had passed the mandatory stop loss rules. I found myself cheating and buying a stock before the proper breakout.  But the rules are good and the paper and online resources will help you find the stocks that meet them. You must learn to become a computer, not a human.<br /><br />Before you get your free trial do this:<br />1) go to Investors.com every day and (free signup for public data) review the market commentary and stock selection of the day, etc.  Do this for at least two weeks to get a feel.<br />2) run through ALL the free online educational data at the site.<br />3) read the O'Neil book ""How to Make Money In Stocks"".<br />4) From the book, learn to read the signs of the market to see if you are in an uptrend or downtrend.  (If there is a place that sells the paper, take a free look at the ""Big Picture"" spot on the top left of front page and see if market is in uptrend, correction or under pressure.<br />5) if you don't have the discipline to do this, don't even bother with the paper!<br /><br />Some of the fundamental CANSLIM rules you probably violate all the time...<br />1) NEVER buy a stock when the market is in a correction<br />2) NEVER average down on a losing stock (but do average up properly on a winning stock)<br />3) NEVER let your loss exceed 7-8%<br />4) Buy right (good fundamentals first, then proper chart pattern and breakout).<br />5) NEVER hold too many stocks, you can't keep up with them and there are only so many great stocks (if your stock is not proving to be at least good shortly after the proper buy point, then sell it and wait for another opportunity or invest proceeds in a better stock you own (at proper add on point)).<br /><br />If this seems odd, read the book FIRST!",[],B00009VPDW,B00009VPDW,AF4S3XFLDZIHO5VVZMOPI5K77UXQ,2013-10-07 03:38:05.000,148,False

Seems to feature a smattering of sport bikes, sport-tourers as well as touring rigs, the larger touring cruisers and liter sized open-bikes.

Then again, so has much of the current state of music and the current performers who may be able to sing but have no idea what a real instrument is.  They may be good on their computer's music software and know auto tune inside and out......but who cares.<br />I long for the day when real rock and roll comes alive again.<br />When that happens, maybe Rolling Stone will, once more, find a heart.<br /><br />Thanks for allowing me to share my thoughts.",[],B002EDTNXQ,B002EDTNXQ,AGDNOK4WENFWV3HIU6EWS3PGKFPQ,2021-03-09 19:22:23.784,1,False

1,"Poor Customer Service, Tiresome Format","I subscribed to Cooks Magazine some years ago, back when it  began publishing again.  I had problems with issues that failed to arrive, and wrote to them about it - never received a reply or any note of concern.<br /><br />Since that time, I occasionally glance through it at newsstands to see if there are any articles of interest.  Even by dint of casual glance, I've begun to tire of the formulaic articles in which some drone takes me on a torturous journey through the addition/deletion of various ingredients in order to finally arrive at the ""perfect recipe"". I now skip right to the ""perfected"" recipe, and decide whether its worth committing to memory.  I should mention that some of the ""perfect"" recipes are mediocre - after all of that torment and flailing around.  Some of the explanations for the success or lack thereof of the inclusion or exclusion of a particular ingredient are not well thought out.  They should keep a copy handy of one of Harold McGee's excellent books on the Science of Cooking.<br />There are also two other areas of this magazine that have disappointed me:<br /><br />1.  Product Reviews:  They range from just plain wrong to idiotic.<br /><br />The KitchenAid Pro 600 stand mixer was hailed by Cook's as the best in its class for many mixing chores.  Yet, Amazon reviews tell a different tale - one of a short lifespan when used to mix bread dough because of a plastic gearbox cover that deforms and finally comes apart, a fatal event that allows the metal gears to separate.<br /><br />Christopher Kimball (the editor) once made an evaluation of cookware in which he calculated the price of the cookware per pound of its weight.  No, I'm not joking.  In that evaluation, Le Creuset was deemed a good buy simply because it was heavy, and therefore cost the least per pound.  All-Clad, even though it conducts heat very evenly, suffered for not having as much heft, and therefore was judged pricey on a pound weight basis.  I might add that I have Le Creuset and All-Clad - both have great heat distribution - but why penalize a saucepan if it can distribute heat as well at half the weight?  It seems as if Mr. Kimball likes to come up with comparisons just for the sake of developing ratings, but not necessarily to measure anything relavent.<br /><br />One issue of Cooks boasted on its cover ""Unsweetened chocolate -supermarket brand beats others"".  Apparently, Hershey's was designated best.  Not too many months later, Callebaut Unsweetened was recommended above all others, and Hershey's was judged barely acceptable.  Feeling manipulated yet?  I've always used Callebaut unsweetened and bittersweet in cooking.  Pity the poor soul to takes these capricious ratings seriously and sprints out to the store to buy the latest and greatest, only to find that the same product is at the bottom of the list a few months later.<br /><br />2.  Finally, there are those dreadful editorials by Mr. Kimball.  Rambling, painfully written, Mr. Kimball seems to be a Garrison Keilor wanna-be.  I recommend that he take a lesson or two on writing from Ruth Reichl.  In contrast, Mr. Kimball writes as if he is chanelling Helen Gurley Brown, but donning red and black flannel watch-plaid and without her sense of play.  If I read another story about 'old Mr. Jeepers' down the road or the local square dance....yawn.",[],B000069YW9,B000069YW9,AGYIPQJ26USK3LBFLVZMGURXDRGA,2006-09-16 00:24:22.000,77,False

1,WARNING-UNAUTHORIZED CHARGES,"Subsequent to my review (below), I was notified that CR was charging me for digital access to their website.  I only subscribed to the magazine.  CR's notice also reminded me that they continue renewing that service automatically unless I intervene.  I canceled such service in the past because I have a problem with auto renewal.  I feel no less kindly to it now.  I've now canceled my sub to the zine, and probably have to hack through customer service to prevent charges to my card.  Doesn't change my previous critique:<br />I thought I'd try the K version of CR, and essentially I like it.  But CR doesn't do well with the conversion of print to e-text.  They don't bother prepping for the e-version is my guess:  they just throw it out there, warts and all.  The read has problems with percentage figures, which for CR is a hindrance.  Words with ""ff"" (e.g., ""offer"") have a problem:  the ff becomes a period.  Other little glitches in text conversion are annoying.  The index does not follow the section being read:  it's stuck wherever you looked at it last, I think, so you have to go looking for where you are; even the local newspaper (which screws up a lot) got that one right.  I'm reading a zine purporting to be experts on products, and theirs has flaws suggesting they've never actually read the output.

I knew this going into the subscription...but in my year of subscribing to the print and digital issues I only received two digital and around four print editions. Even with the lack of getting every issue I paid for I found the content lacking. I learned nothing new from any of the articles during my subscription. The most common thing in the magazine is ads by Family Tree Magazine to buy other products and services from them. The number of their own ads in their own magazine for their own products was in my opinion way over the top. To sum it up it feel that I was under delivered on the number of issues I was due, the subscription price was too high and the content amount was too low and the amount of ads was too high. For the amount of ads for their own products they should give the magazine out as a ad flyer that happen to have a few basic articles thrown in to pretend to be a magazine with real content.",[],B000066HVN,B000066HVN,AEKA6P23W736SWJE5V7GI3WHTAYQ,2016-10-29 03:51:43.000,88,True

1,Terrible (from a 10-year-old).,"When a 10-year-old can point out the fallacies in a magazine, you can’t deny it’s garbage.  I don’t usually look at the magazines his grandmother sends him, but he brought up a few things in the first issue and I brushed them off.  Then this second issue came and he was commenting how he thought this magazine was stating some pretty false claims.  (To give a little perspective, he reads college chemistry and aerospace texts for fun).  He outright laughed at the claim that educating girls would solve a climate crisis (see photo).  If you want to develop intelligence, this is not the magazine (really, no magazine will help with that).  To be clear, he’s not a misogynist and I am not a part of the patriarchy.  I think we can all agree that claim is unsubstantiated.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815Y72BkJ3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815Y72BkJ3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815Y72BkJ3L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81PqGDs7E-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81PqGDs7E-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81PqGDs7E-L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0160CPI3A,B0160CPI3A,AFVQH2T43A2XBJ5UTMKGGHTTAHFQ,2020-02-04 14:55:56.141,27,False

1,FULL-COVER WRAPAROUND ADS???,"My 7-year-old received a subscription for this magazine as a gift from his grandparents. He likes it a lot. He sits down with it when it arrives and reads through it very quickly. It's got some good information in its pages, as well as some great pictures. It has some ads, which I don't care for since I really don't like marketing aimed at kids, but I figured an ad here and there for Goldfish crackers isn't that big a deal. Until today, when my son starts asking me out of the blue to get him a Super Mario gaming system. Repeatedly. Then I see that the National Geographic Kids Magazine had arrived--and parading as the front cover is ad for Super Mario Brothers on the DS! I am not exaggerating--it was a full-cover wrap-around ad!  Thanks, National Geographic Kids! Instead of Exciting my Kid About His World, you got him excited about...VIDEO GAMES!!! YAY! Educational magazine at its finest, right there!<br /><br />This sort of crap is utterly unacceptable. I am reviewing it here so that others know what they will be purchasing for their children if they subscribe. You will be getting advertisements for things completely unrelated to the natural sciences, including expensive video gaming systems. I tried to write a message on their Facebook pages, but wouldn't you know, you can't post anything there.

While I have been honing my culinary talents in some areas (like homemade cinnamon rolls or waffles on occasion), I had not made a homemade potato salad in years. I think this issue of the publication has the best article on potato salad I have ever read, and I just made the best potato salad I've ever made. I used Hellman's real mayonnaise mixed with Greek yogurt over nicely boiled and cubed Yukon Gold potatoes to which some salt, black pepper and red wine vinegar had been added. I mixed in fresh chives, radishes, and celery as well as some Spanish capers. One recipe called for boiling the potatoes in white rice wine, but I didn't have any. I topped the mixture with paprika. I didn't use eggs, but the potatoes were delicious without them.<br /><br />What I loved about the feature was the fantastic layout of the article which clarified the two broad types of potato salads and the host of ingredients that can be added.

4,Stunning Modern Design for the Reasonable Among Us,"Here is a magazine that focuses on modern design and clean-line architecture without the trendy vibe that makes a competitor like ""Wallpaper"" an expensive, hit-or-miss read. What I like most about ""Dwell"" is its consistency in presenting interesting designs from around the world that look quite livable and fashionable at the same time. Even the advertisements are quite compatible to the flow of the magazine, so much so that they often look like they are part of the editorial. There is a very useful ""Marketplace"" section at the end that tells you where to get a lot of the art, furniture and accessories complementary to the designs presented. I have often used these helpful listings to find some interesting things for my own place.<br /><br />This magazine is definitely geared toward the urban loft dweller, but I like how they highlight homes with families in mind as well. Individual issues are often focused on either geographic or utility-related themes, thus keeping a library mandatory for future reference. The photography is superb. If you are tired of design magazines that seem to be talking specifically to designers, this is a great, reasonably priced alternative for people who simply appreciate great design. Highly recommended.",[],B00005NIRE,B00005NIRE,AEBZFMNIRS5U4DQN2BVEYZFKRXEA,2005-12-02 16:38:41.000,72,False
5,"Opera for the Masses, Polished and Informative","I have only recently become an opera enthusiast partially because I realized I needed to be old enough to appreciate it and also because of my intimidation of those who are quite knowledgeable about it. That's why I heartily endorse a subscription to ""Opera News"", which I find to be by far, the most reader-friendly of magazines dedicated to opera and classical music. It is probably not as comprehensive as others are, but it makes for educational and entertaining reading at a level that would make sense to anyone interested in learning more about opera. Published monthly by the Metropolitan Opera Guild, it naturally places primary focus on the Met's performances, but it also does an excellent job in covering performances at venues around the world. The layout and graphic quality are as polished as any popular entertainment publication.<br /><br />The feature articles are consistently informative and well-written, especially in their efforts to broaden perspectives on opera relative to other performing arts (e.g., Broadway, early movie musicals) and spotlighting historic performances. Generally showcased as the cover stories, there are in-depth profiles of the leading performers - rising, established and legendary. There is also a comprehensive section devoted to reviews of recordings and performances available on CD and DVD, which I find very helpful in prioritizing my own purchase decisions. In fact, I was lucky enough to travel to New York last month to see the wondrous Stephen Wadsworth production of Handel's ""Rodelinda"" at the Met, and the December 2004 issue (with star countertenor David Daniels on the cover) gave me all the information I could use to heighten my anticipation of that superb performance. If you are a long-time opera aficionado or a neophyte like myself, it would be difficult to find a more worthwhile publication on the newsstands. Also worth noting is the accompanying Web site ([...]) that includes online exclusives of particular reviews, easy access to archived issues and daily news updates in the opera world.",[],B00005N7XO,B00005N7XO,AEBZFMNIRS5U4DQN2BVEYZFKRXEA,2005-01-28 05:35:12.000,9,False

4,Great if it suits your needs,"I just started reading ROLLING STONE over the past year.  I am in my 40s and know the type of magazine ROLLING STONE always was.  In all honestly it never drew me in.  When I was younger I followed more of the main stream music which Rolling Stone did not cover.  They highlighted the inventive, creative and genre bending artists - the music that defined true artists or periods in time.  I was a young kid loving his pop music.<br /><br />As I aged I have changed and now love all types of music.  I might have appreciated the magazine when it was in its glory if my knowledge and interests were as they are now.  For me, I thoroughly enjoy each issue I receive while at the same time understand why true ROLLING STONE enthusiasts would often be shaking their head at what they see.  In the recent past we had Clay Aiken on the cover.  I enjoy Clay's vocals but am the first to say he is in no way a defining voice in music.  He is pure pop, recording music for pure marketability.  I think old school ROLLING STONE readers could overlook such things as a Clay Aiken cover if indeed he was a trend setter or in some way representative of the new school of music.  Burt he is none of these things.<br /><br />The latest issue is part old school and part new.  The cover story is on the breakup of the Beatles.  It is an indepth well written article that reminds one of the magazine in its prime.  But then we go to the music reviews and one of the longest reviews is of the new Whitney Houston cd.  This is her comeback but again - Whitney was not a trendsetter in any way.  She sang commercial music and had tons of top ten hits.  Yes, she had an amazing voice with great range but a musical milestone?  No, not definable as a musical touching stone in music.<br /><br />So I fully understand ROLLING STONE purists who feel the magazine sold out and that their resource for musical changes, inventiveness and how music affects the world is gone.  Instead we have a rougher edged ENTETAINMENT WEEKLY.  I love the music reviews plus the movie reviews.  My tastes are eclectic as the magazine now is.  There are touches of the old magazine mixed in but it is not enough for most old schoolers.  But for those new to the magazine it may just be exactly what you are looking for.  The articles are indepth and vary from politics, music, movies and profiles.  The reviews are excellent and cover all genres in both music and movies.  As I said this issue is a great example of whether the magazine will suit you.  There is an amazing article on the Beatles but we also have an indepth look at the American Idol tour.  If all this appeals to you then you will love ROLLING STONE.  If it fills you with anger I am sorry for thos musical purists who have lost their musical bible.",[],B00005N7SJ,B00005N7SJ,AHWYSJIMUEIUBSBWKASEA5WOSCGA,2009-08-25 17:01:21.000,5,False
2,Save the trees,"I am 48 and I remember when I was in my 20s occasionally picking up this magazine and enjoying looking at the clothes I could never afford.  Now I got a good deal on a subscription thru Amazon and gave it another try.  Whatever interest it held for me 30 years ago is long gone. I get the magazines each month and flip thru them within 10 minutes.<br /><br />GQ always had clothes that were only affordable to the ultra wealthy and only dreams for us mere mortals.  A weird thing has happened though.  In the past even if expensive they showed diferrent varying styles of clothes that would cater to all age ranges and economic classes.  Now I look at the clothes and don't mind the prices for I don't even like what I see.  I do know a little bit about fashion and fall in the middle class range.  These clothes are things I would never wear even if I could afford them and most are of a style I never see in any settings I may enter in my life travels.  To me these are wasted pages of attractive models wearing fashion that no ilk of man would wear.<br /><br />Also in the past I would always find a couple of articles that peaked my interest in each issue but not anymore.  Reviews are not really valid for they are written catering to the supposed magazines audience and not being honest.  If lucky there will be an interesting main article, an interview with the cover male.  In my last issue it was Channing Tatum.  I learned some about him but have honestly learned more elsewhere.  The interesting thing was I really liked the clothes he was wearing in his pictures.  They dressed him in clothes I could imagine average men wearing.<br /><br />So bottiom line, if this magazine caters to your demographic then you will love it and I apologize for trashing it a little.  But it is definitely about the clothes.  If the styles do not appeal to you then you will find very little else in the magazine to make it a worthwhile read.

For my potato casserole I used fontina cheese.  Everyone went crazy for it.  In fact, I love this recipe so much I could eat it 3 times a day.

2,Magazine gained a new editor but lost interesting content,"The magazine has suffered, in my humble opinion, under the new editor since over a year ago.  When Nancy Novogrod was the editor I truly looked forward to my next issue.  Under her direction the articles matched the glossy photos.  Of course, the magazine is for the well-heeled, but when Ms. Novogrod handled the editing I still felt as though I could dream about those featured destinations.  There was a good variety of destinations featured monthly.<br /><br />However, under Nathan Lump's direction the magazine, I feel, is geared towards the millennial generation mostly.  Oh, the photos are really still glossy, but the destinations are mostly for the adventurer not really for a traditionalist.  I would have preferred to see more of Europe and less of Asia and the US.  But it seems as though the majority of the articles relate to the latter.  Seldom do they feature Europe.  And when they do it's about the same theme:  Eating and drinking spots geared to the younger generation mostly.  Or shops that are for the eclectic types.<br /><br />Thus, I am not very enthused about looking forward to receiving my new issue monthly as I did in the past.",[],B00005NIP7,B00005NIP7,AFUE7XV35MUCR4Z6E327JBJB2R2Q,2014-12-23 18:16:19.000,2,False
4,If you don't watch the runways..,"Let me start by saying that fashion is ageless, and Harper's Bazaar does a decent job of highlighting the notable runway pieces. That being said:<br /><br />-Almost all the editorials are geared towards much older women: girls in their teens and twenties can flip through runway summaries, but countless articles on why they should botox the crap out of their face isn't really useful.<br />(funny--there's always some ""beauty is ageless! celebrate older women!"" articles along with the ""your lips are gone, puff them up you silly old woman! inject that Restylane! you need 4 IPL treatments!"" advice)<br /><br />-About 70% of the magazine is pure advertisements. Which is fine, because most contribute to a greater aesthetic. There are, however, a lot of oddball outfits (mm I didn't know bedazzling with rhinestones was stylish, Saks Fifth Avenue!). Oh, and the ever so classy Palladium jewelry ads.<br /><br />-The ""fashion"" advice is somewhat contradictory. For example, one column advised you to ""store away"" a type of shoe which was featured literally the page before, and maybe 30 other times throughout the magazine. The shoe they recommended instead, I did not see at all.<br /><br />So if you  take away all the anti-aging botox promotions and the ads, you're left with maybe 10 pages of runway highlights; this is of course, including the contradictory fashion advice you might not care to take. If this magazine is worth all the paper, then you'll be happy. If you thought you'd be getting more for 250 pages a month, you should look elsewhere. I didn't pay that much for this magazine, and it is fun to flip through, but I don't know if I would renew it.<br /><br />(also.. I don't think it's fair to give Harper's Bazaar 1/5 stars because the vender didn't supply you--there's a separate company/delivery feedback.

For &#34;shelter&#34;, it said to buy a modular house.  For &#34;grow your own food&#34;, it said to make a garden (and buy a $1000 wheat mill).  The rest of the article, supposedly about survival, is a rambling story of how the author doesn't have any survival skills and how his father put sprinklers on top of the house he built to help save it from a wildfire.

It’s a magazine that I have relished in paper copy in the past, but now I want the speed and convenience of Kindle version.  So, going in, I knew I enjoy the content and am willing to pay for it.<br /><br />The Paris Review sent to my Kindle the current issue immediately upon my signing up here in Amazon. It was readable, although slightly difficult to navigate on the Kindle Paperwhite and my larger Kindle app in 12” iPad Pro. Hard to describe, but they lump articles together in packets of four or six, and I find gong in and out of that arrangement non-intuitive. Yet, I would continue if that was the only flaw (even though it needs to be fixed).<br /><br />I follow TPReview Twitter page and only because of that I know the Winter issue is out. The latest issue is being spoken of and highlighted and some articles are being distributed there.  But, sync, sync sync, not coming to me.  So, I wait several days, sync sync, sync.  Nothing. I check my Amazon subscription page, yep, I’m subscribed. After 🤔 thinking it over, I decided to cancel.  Sure, I could call TPReview and inquire, sure, they’d likely “push” the latest issue to my Kindle account.  But, I’m going to think about this every three months? Life too short, and I have other things to think of, don’t need one more. Frankly, like with my newspaper for Kindle subscriptions, I thought I’d wake up the morning the new issue came out and have it waiting right there for me.

1,downhill and not any semblence of its former glory,"another great magazine lost its zing. I couldn't renew for 2014 because I use to enjoy this magazine. The photos were gorgeous and it was a nice get away from the hustle and bustle.

I realize the need for person products, but HELLO, wrong VENUE for that type of ad. It use to be a family friendly mag, I think having ads for highly personal products splattered in a family type mag is HIGHLY inappropriate, c'mon now. Nothing is sacred or personal anymore, and that is a shame. But then all mags these days are just pages and pages of ads, and zero interesting content, and with all those ads, WHY did the subscription price of so many mags soar. Advertising is suppose to OFFSET publishing costs, or it use to...but instead mags are just ad booklets these days, nothing worth spending $ on. Why pay for anything that has no valuable content! I no longer get Birds and Blooms either because the placement of the ads, just killed the beauty it as well.

1,Don’t Support These Homophobic People! Con Artist!,"I know a lot about these people and they are only interested in one thing, MONEY! It’s precisely why it’s full of advertisements! These people came into Waco and made over several different houses for their TV show “Fixer-Uppers which in turn made the taxes for shoddy work add a lot to homeownership for the people who thought they where being helped! It caused their property taxes to double in some instances! It’s not a secret in Central Texas that these people are not what most perceive! They are also Homophobic and they are religious nut jobs! They have no TV in their mansion and they have always remolded other peoples homes in a way that a TV doesn’t fit anywhere!<br /><br />I have thumbed thru a few copies of this, as my sister in law use to get it until I told her how these people truly are. They are known for Fixer-Upper’s which has been criticized for being rushed and done very shoddy in order to get the show out of production to air in time. Some people have had to get work redone after they where left with an incomplete renovation.<br /><br />They bought a Historical Resturant that was opened up in 1919 called the Elite Cafe. It was so successful the brother’s opened up a second Cafe on the Waco Circle that has confused many travelers before the interstate was built, in 1944. A strong and deadly tornado hit Waco in 1953 and destroyed downtown Waco. The owners of the Elite Circle Resturant which was a second location of their original Restaurant lost their original 1919 building and focused on the Elite Circle until it closed down in 2016. Many residents and even the mayor of Waco had a lot to say about the original plans that Chip and Joanna had originally planned for the restaurant and they had to revise their design as the Resturant is a historical landmark in Waco. Now it’s a 3hr wait for pancakes,  as I have heard, and a tourist trap.<br /><br />Their renovated Elite Cafe Restaurant is now called Magnolia Table. There’s a large sign inside that says “Where Everyone Has A Seat At The Table”! Yes you do if you have 3 or more hours of spare time to wait for a seat. Then there’s the Silo’s in Waco that are extremely overpriced and have actually been a thorn in the side of many of the original businesses in the area. Waco has limited parking and it’s now like trying to find a parking spot in NYC! It’s all just a huge tourist trap and it’s a double edged sword! It’s good for the Waco economy, but it’s also been accused of gentrification of the downtown area as many of the businesses that have been there for years are owned by minorities! These people are just looking to make money!<br /><br />These people are not interested in anything but the all mighty dollar. They left Fixer-Uppers after season five and claim they needed space to get their lives on track. It’s my opinion that they separated for a short time, but deny it and my opinion is that they needed each other for their money making machine to continue to bring in the bucks!",[],B01N35UMQV,B01N35UMQV,AEIFQ2M4OJBXTDQFXOUCIYOTDHEA,2022-03-06 04:02:57.246,1,False

I've been sharing a co-workers copy of this magazine for quite a while, so I intended to renew the subscription anyway - but I would have preferred to make that decision for myself AFTER I'd received my three trial issues.

1,Auto-renewal Beware and Dull Content,"I was very hopeful to get new ideas from ""Real Simple"" but that was a failure all around! Ideas were totally too stupid or so simplistic that they were ones I had doing for years and most times in a more simplistic way than their ideas. Recipes were of no interest to me as they were too detailed using many more ingredients than I would use or want to buy. Unfortunately, for me, I do not like or ever want to consume fish, tofu, fermented ingredients, alcohol brined foods (taste is a little strange), escargot, or strange ingredients growing on forest floors. I have tried them all but do want to include them in my daily diet, ever again. I even heard, on a TV show that vegan meat products were worse for a person than eating small portions of real meat as they contain excessive amounts of sodium in an effort to make the product taste better. Articles were mostly for younger women, like mature wannabees and so is the clothing. I could just flip through the magazine doing a quick scan and before sending on to another person. Then I tried to cancel and was ignored - oh yes, the automatic renewal got me and gave me another wasteful year of junk mail....even though I had changed my credit card on the website but Amazon just took care of that and passed me along with the new number. Because of COVID, no hospital or doctor office will accept any magazine donations for their waiting rooms, so they become landfill. No recycling services where I like either.

Persimmons...they are native to North America.  Hell, they could have reached out to local native American communities to discover recipes that cater to fall in North America.

4,Important publisher of U.S. poetry,"APR publishes in volume and, within self-imposed limitations of its editorial bias, in high quality. This alone sets it apart from most every other print outlet for poetry. I may like only 20% of what I read in a particular issue, but I am one who subscribes to the print version of the NYT to get the weekend Book Review section. The essays tend to the New Yorker / Harpers long format, or academic, or both -- not easily skimmed.<br /><br />APR, like most other literary magazines, suffers from the myopic view of most humanities publications: the editors tend to select writing that ignores goings-on in science, technology and interdisciplinary confluences.<br /><br />This periodical has one disagreeable feature. The large format, low quality paper may attract some, but I find it in opposition to the very nature of poetry. There's something wrong about finding walked-over, muddy copies of APR on the floor of your local Starbucks along with used car ads from your local newspaper. Or would that be a good thing? I've subscribed off and on for a couple of decades, and it's, by design, not a satisfying collectible.<br /><br />I tried reading it on Zinio over the last year, but the Zinio UI seems to have been designed by Martians.<br /><br />UPDATE Here it is 2019 late January and I still can't find a web subscription.

3,Misleading Title,"I thought I'd try this magazine based on the title Reason. While I was expecting a magazine focusing on critical thought, and maybe some philosophy and psychology, I was pretty disappointed because it just seemed to be a political magazine espousing libertarian ideals. While the majority of the magazine was articles discussing why government and regulations are bad, there was one article I really enjoyed in my first issue. It was an interview with Stewart Brand, who I had never heard of before. Interestingly, he actually criticized Reason magazine in the interview. I have to say I respect that the editors of Reason kept that in the magazine. I cancelled after my second issue because it was just more of the same, minus any articles that were interesting to me this time around.<br /><br />If you're into Libertarianism, you might actually enjoy this magazine. The articles tend to run on the long side, and can be kind of dry, but they did seem to make an effort to remain fairly objective.<br /><br />For those of you looking for a magazine less about politics and more about reason, critical thinking, and thought in general, I would recommend skipping this magazine and checking out [[ASIN:B00006KX3K Skeptical Inquirer]] or [[ASIN:B002PXVYNW Psychology Today]].",[],B00005N7NQ,B00005N7NQ,AHRTK5PEXHZSMJXWWVALSHHK5UHQ,2010-10-09 00:36:01.000,4,True

4,Lighthearted & fun feminist mag,"Bust is an entertaining, highly readable magazine aimed at 20- and 30-something women who unashamedly self-identify as feminists.  It reflects a heavy influence of NYC/Brooklyn and the indie scene.  The journalism is not terribly political or hard-hitting, but I don't think it intends to be.  Bust does occasionally discuss things like comprehensive sex ed, breastfeeding in public, and misogynistic commercial ads; however, for the most part, the content is on the lighthearted side.  I have subscribed for almost a year, although I've read it intermittently off newsstands since 2005, and overall, I really enjoy reading it.<br /><br />The great thing about Bust is that it has substance and is fun to read.  There are never articles like ""How to Look Thinner,"" ""Choose the Right Anti-Aging Surgical Procedure,"" and other inane, self-hate-inducing garbage typically found in mainstream women's mags.  By contrast, Bust has articles on female stand-up comedians, women who travel the world volunteering, and how to choose the right vibrator or electric guitar.  (These are also great examples of how Bust has a more lighthearted tone than Ms. or [...].)  [MM edit: Thanks a lot, Amazon, for editing out the word B**ch right there -- it's the name of a feminist magazine, not a derogatory term.  Just shows you how far we still have to come.]<br /><br />Bust's regular features include:<br /><br />* Feminist interest columns -- Pop Tart, a tongue-in-cheek take on current pop culture; Museum of Femoribilia, with articles on women's cultural objects (swimsuit bra cups, restrictive petticoats, girls' toys, etc.) from the 1920s on and the feminist issues raised by them; and Mother Superior, by Ayun Halliday, who writes self-effacingly and hilariously about her kids' antics<br /><br />* DIY projects -- Make your own queen-size headboard, reusable tote bags, mod-themed tea towels, pillbox hat, subversive cross-stitch art, etc.<br /><br />* Recipes -- Chinese wontons, gingersnaps, tsimmes, mozzarella cheese (yes, how to curdle cheese), how to throw an eco-friendly Thanksgiving feast<br /><br />* Boy du Jour -- A short interview with a hot, progressive, not-so-mainstream dude<br /><br />* Fashion features -- Trend spotting; up-and-coming independent designers; a multi-page fashion spread illustrating a current trend (steampunk, outdoorsy hippie, cowgirl, 80s rock-chic)<br /><br />* Interviews with 1-2 progressive celebrities<br /><br />* Travel -- Articles on domestic and international destinations, with suggestions on restaurants, worthy hole-in-the-wall shops, things to do and see<br /><br />* Sex -- Reader Q&A with Betty Dodson and, more recently, Carlin Ross (this can get graphic at times, but it's info we were all wondering anyway); Sex Files, a column discussing general women's health topics; the ""One-Handed Read,"" stories similar to those in other popular women's mags (i.e., porn for women)<br /><br />* Reviews of 1) not-so-mainstream beauty products, 2) recent indie music, 3) books written by or about women, and 4) recent indie movies produced/directed/written by or about women<br /><br />* Comic strip detailing the trialz & tribz of a high school sophomore in the 1980s (by Esther Pearl Watson) and a feminist-themed crossword puzzle at the end -- I luuurve the comic strip and the crossword!<br /><br />Bust is really big on indie musicians, especially those with a progressive bent, male or female.  There is always at least one feature on a musician in each issue.<br /><br />It's also important to note that Bust is not misandronistic in any way; in fact, they're very open about appreciating, crushing on, and having relations with men.<br /><br />However, here's my one gripe: Bust has a somewhat ""exclusive"" vibe.  Don't get me wrong -- they're not out there bashing people who don't subscribe to their indie ethos; they're just not inclusive of a wide audience.  I agree with a previous reviewer about the general lack of inclusion of women of color (and I am white).  There are, of course, some exceptions to this -- like the features on Eve, Rosario Dawson, Margaret Cho, Charlyne Yi, Sandrah Oh, and Rosie Perez, for example.  But these features may be too few and far-between for women of color to feel truly championed.  The bottom line is that Bust just aims for a very specific audience, which happens to be white, straight, crafty, indie/hipster feminists in their 20s and 30s.  For some people, this may feel alienating.  I occasionally feel like I'm not ""hipster enough"" for Bust, even though I'm pretty sure I fit into their intended demographic. ;)<br /><br />Despite this, I continue to read Bust because I enjoy the positive media outlet it provides, especially compared to the likes of Glamour, Vogue, Cosmo -- which make ALL women feel like crap, regardless of heritage, size, and interests.  Personally, I get enough positive value out of Bust as a whole to let the occasional self-doubt slide.<br /><br />Overall, Bust is an enjoyable, lighthearted, pro-woman magazine.  I'd suggest you check it out at Borders or B&N before subscribing, just to get an idea of its readability and look/feel.

The stories are not &#34;about&#34; diversity and the background/ability is not the focus of the story, they just have a story (going to the beach, looking for sparkly things, growing tomatoes, etc) and the characters in the pictures are diverse.  this aspect is my #1 reason I like this magazine.<br />2) There are lots of puzzles and games, and it's nice to have something to challenge the brain that my kid doesn't think of as 'work' (in contrast to the alphabet workbook I've been trying to get her to practice!)<br />I should also note that my LO likes the magazine too and gets very excited when each issue arrives.<br />We also subscribe to National Geographic Little Kids and Ranger Rick Jr.  , which obviously have different focuses and are complementary.",[],B079P9BVGQ,B079P9BVGQ,AFINFIT7EFE5RFVRUECSDDEWU6IA,2018-04-24 20:16:37.851,3,False

It's also good that the Mass is going to be EXACTLY what it's supposed to be that day; no guess work as is sometimes necessary with the regular Missal. As a new Catholic, this is VERY helpful.<br /><br />I've been using the St. Joseph Daily and Sunday Missals and I will keep them close but will probably only take the Magnificat to Mass from now on.<br /><br />Pages are thin...

5,The Standard Foreign Affairs Journal,"Two decades ago as a bright eyed Navy Ensign I wanted to know more about why I was sent overseas.  After a bit of research I found out that the Council on Foreign Relations, a prestigious foreign affairs think tank, published a journal entitled Foreign Affairs and subscribed.  That's how I came to find Foreign Affairs and I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />Foreign Affairs quickly turned out to be one of the best journals I have ever read.  As a young Ensign traveling the world, it provided great insight on why we were out there doing what we were doing.  Between its covers, you'll find long thoughtful and insightful essays written by Condolezza Rice, Robert Gates, Rumsfeld, Kaplan, Brzizinski and scores of others making their cases for why America should pursue certain courses of action.  Many times these articles precede the mass media news by months on where America is going.<br /><br />The journal is published six times a year and has:<br />- 2 to 3 Reasonably sized Comments<br />- 8 to 10 Essays written by leaders of government<br />- 4 to 5 Book Reviews and Responses<br /><br />Everything is very well written and thoroughly researched.  In short, you won't find a better journal on Foreign Affairs.  Since first subscribing almost two decades ago, I have read all the other political science journals out there and have found that Foreign Affairs is the standard international affairs journal by which all others are measured.  These are the essays that are at the forefront of what politicians are discussing.<br /><br />The more I studied and the more I learned, more I also started reading Plato, Locke, Hobbs, other classical works - the more I realized that Foreign Affairs is the purest of Rhetoric...and Foreign Affairs is rhetoric of a very high order.<br /><br />So profoundly did Foreign Affairs and Military service affect me that I went on to get a postgrad in international affairs and economics. Diplomatic international affairs, the rhetoric, is America's first line of defense in a broad international battlefield that is fought primarily with words but which certainly is tied to lives and blood when the rhetoric escalates to a certain degree.  For example, Europe not supporting America during the Iraq war had the price of additional American lives lost....the price for losing the war of words with Europe with respect to Iraq cost us in the currency of blood.<br /><br />Overall foreign affairs is a battlefield where the British, French, Germans, Arabs, Chinese, Japanese, the giant corporations of the world and others fight for the hearts and minds of the American People(with America being one of the most diverse societies in the world) and for the hearts and minds of people around the world.  Many times, things get very complex and its hard to tell who is America's friend and who is not and sometimes our friends on one front are our enemies in another.  In the end, we have to assume that CFR is PRO AMERICA - otherwise, we're really in a pile of doo doo, but yes - even CFR is swayed by the forces of Foreign Affairs and Diplomacy.  Diplomacy is probably the most complex chess game we play and its a game where the stakes are so high that we can't afford to lose.  Foreign Affairs, the publication, gives you a front seat to the game.<br /><br />If you want to understand, contribute, or at least not detract -- subscribe.  Only through knowledge can you engage in thoughful debate.",[],B00007LN7R,B00007LN7R,AG3YSGTHAD3XS22MCYKNMVKVIKGA,2009-03-07 14:36:40.000,20,False

What it's become:  every unrealistic &#34;women's magazine&#34; on the market, with a matte cover for &#34;simplicity&#34;.  Either the target audience is the 1% - or maybe the .1% - or a whole lot of people have some pretty self important and impractical ideas of what constitutes reality.<br /><br />Their latest project, the Real Simple Home.  Let's see.  1. Start with a brand new $8+ Million dollar &#34;family apartment&#34;.  2. Move on from there:  you can afford an $8M apartment - mortgage, condo fees, taxes, utilities, a place to store your off season furniture and movers to shuffle it around every few months, plus the extra $10,000 or so per month in unplanned expenses, but you desperately need help choosing affordable off the rack furniture. 3. Ok, so you can't quite afford an $8M apartment.  But you can still get useful design ideas by ignoring the fact that every room looks magnificent Because Of Floor To Ceiling Windows 15 stories up in the air.

5,Consumer Reports for Dogs & their Owners,"I've been subscribing to WHOLE DOG JOURNAL publication for years.  It is a very holistic publication and I was introduced to it by my vet, who carries it in ALL of her exam rooms.<br /><br />I don't agree with everything in it, but do feel it has great reviews on dog products & foods like a CONSUMER REPORTS (for dog owners) since it is entirely funded by subscriptions (no advertising).  (It also has helpful contact info or websites at the end of each article.)  My dogs have been helped by any number of articles.<br /><br />There are also training articles, on a regular basis, as well as medical articles; herbs/acupuncture/gold bead implants/raw diets etc.  They believe whole-heartedly in positive training methods & I don't argue with that, but I don't personally care for clicker training.  (Not that you shouldn't try it, just I prefer to use physical & verbal praise.)  You have to ""fade off"" the clicker - it can't go in the ring w/ you, but praise can always be used.<br /><br />Now, WDJ is offering to send you frequent blog-type emailings (weekly) on tips & info, for being a subscriber, if you've given them an email address & don't opt out.  They will also cite several helpful related WDJ articles on the topic, you can read online from past issues.  Today's main email was on crate-training, but they also had how to develop Reliable Recalls.  (I found some helpful tips I had forgotten, or overlooked, despite being in dogs for 25 years.)  Nothing is more likely to save your dog's life, than a RELIABLE recall, IMO.<br /><br />I'm not sure if you can use this link or not:<br />[...]<br /><br />You can also look up ARCHIEVED articles on any subject they've EVER covered, if you are a subscriber.  Example: articles in cancer treatments & special cancer diets.)  So, if you've misplaced or thrown away an old article, or can't figure out when you read it, you can still find it.  Or, if you start subscribing (now) you can get the benefit of everything they've covered, even when you weren't a subscriber.  (It also means you can donate old issues &lt;clutter?> if you need more space.)<br /><br />I still think (after 10 years of being with them) that WDJ is the very BEST dog publication out there, bar NONE.  If you only subscribe to one dog publication, this is the one to invest in, IMO.  I am in no way affiliated w/ it, & have never submitted or published any articles in it.",[],B000Y12580,B000Y12580,AFVDXM5T2JJEWL4TVPRGY7GUM5HA,2010-07-20 18:52:49.000,17,False

1,The magazine switched from 11 issues to 6 per year sometime during my sub,"I like to run, I've been running for 17-18 years, and I bought a subscription to Runner's World in the hopes it would help give me inspiration and motivation to sign up for a race (it has been several years since I've last done a marathon).<br /><br />Somewhere in my 12 month, 11 issue subscription, Runner's World switched to a 6 issue per year model, which isn't what I subscribed to.  I'm not blaming Amazon for not knowing what was going to happen because I don't think it's their fault, but I'm also not renewing my subscription because I wish that Runner's World had been more upfront with their sales strategy, and I have to admit, I feel a little swindled.  I was wondering why it seemed slow to show up in the mailbox each month, and then I got my ""renewal"" email saying it is 6 issues per year.<br /><br />Overall, I think this magazine is ""sort of"" informative for runners.  It will frequently focus on elite athletes or someone who has overcome an obstacle (addiction, obesity, disease) to do fantastic things.  Sometimes there are fun tips, exercises, stretches, and recipes.  I like all of that.  But, I feel like the main focus has become more advertising and ""shoe guides"".  I am only going to buy so many pairs of running shoes a year (in 2018, I believe I bought 4-5 pairs (I ran 1660 miles, so 4 pairs sounds about right), 3 of them being Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 33 because I like to run in them), and when every issue focuses on new shoes, that's not that helpful to me.<br /><br />I like running, I like reading about other people running, but this magazine is not that inspirational or motivational for me.  I've found a lot more inspiration by reading running books, looking at running blogs, and mostly listening to podcasts on running (while running!), and none of those things are trying to sell me any running shoes or gear.

3,A happy and informative magazine,"I liked this magazine when it first came out. There were tons of coupons in it, for stuff I actually used. Now, for the past year, I find there is less coupons for good stuff, and more for junk I won't use. The customer service I find to be great, as for 2 or 3 years now I have received quite a lovely  box from All You with quite alot of sample and full size products in it, all just for being a good customer and being active when getting emails from them. Also, I have several times received a sample of something throughout the year to try and then give my opinion of the product. I don't know if you have to be a subscriber of the magazine or just be on their email mailing list to get the goodies, because I have subscribed for basically the last three years. I haven't renewed yet this year, I'm waiting for a much better price than $20+ a year. I read another review in which the person stated that the issues at the newstand have more or better coupons in it, and if that is true, perhaps it is because a person would pay more for the magazine for a single issue than with a subscription. Just a guess. Anyway, I will eventually renew, but I will take my time and get the best price.",[],B000W3MB5W,B000W3MB5W,AEV7FAVL5J5U7KTGHLKLEATBBYFA,2011-02-28 07:27:32.000,1,False

Their bias shows. PCMAG frequently has articles about the 2 most popular operating systems, plus plenty of articles about Linux distros, too.

3,Alternative Strategies to Subscribing,"I've been a subscriber on and off for years.  This is the best magazine for Linux as many have said, but the pricing puts it out of reach of most people.  I found the best alternative was not to subscribe but allocate the money to buying linux books instead.  After all, on Amazon you can buy a new Linux book every month for this price!  I go to a local store that carries this magazine, take a look at the latest issue.  If something really interests me (about 20% of the time), I buy it there.  If not, then I get on Amazon and pick one of the latest titles.  This is a much better solution, because in general although the articles and reviews are first rate, they are generally incomplete because of the space limitations of a magazine.  You can also wait and purchase the magazine collections on line on DVD when they are available, or just go to your local &#34;library&#34; - remember those? - and look at their copy, take some notes, and then research articles on the web.  Its really too bad that the U.S. can't produce a good Linux magazine, or much else for that matter these days.  I'd give it 5 stars, but the price knocks it down a couple notches.  On the other hand you should see my linux library now!",[],B0009GJ2TK,B0009GJ2TK,AHHIZS4UM4B3JFON4IPXSM2YNIHQ,2013-11-15 20:05:42.000,2,False

5,Long Time Subscriber,"I bought my first gun, a Beretta 92, in May 1999 in response to the Columbine tragedy.  It was a ""silent protest"" against the heartless anti-gun political opportunists who were exploiting the victims during the aftermath, which made me sick & disgusted.  It wasn't long after that first purchase when I began a subscription to ""Handguns"" magazine.  I was a subscriber for 10 years until a couple months ago when I decided not to renew my subscription for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that I live in California, home of the ""certified safe by the state"" approved roster of handguns for sale, which prohibits most new models from being sold in CA unless they're bastardized to meet state requirements.<br /><br />Well, you don't subscribe to a magazine for 10 years if it's crappy, right?  This is a great magazine, and all about handguns.  It contains the usual articles you would expect about new models and such, plus firing line reports for several models in each issue, but it also contains ancillary topics such as tactics, gun rights, ammunition, new accessory items on the market, nostalgic reviews of classic handguns, etc.  It's a bi-monthly publication from the publishers of ""Guns & Ammo"", which of course is the gold standard by which all other shooting publications are judged.  I believe ""Handguns"" carries on the tradition of G&A nicely.  This magazine isn't as thick as its main competitor (American Handgunner), but I prefer ""Handguns"" because they stick to business, while AH seems to be run by a bunch of narcisistic egomaniacs who use their magazine as a forum for patting themselves on the back.  I think ""Handguns"" also has a better command of English grammar than AH and is easier to read, though they're still a far cry from perfect in that regard.  However, AH has a handgun giveaway contest in each issue, which ""Handguns"" does not, so props to AH for that.<br /><br />If I had to criticize anything in ""Handguns"", it would be the gun rights column.  At times--not very often, but sometimes--the author (Don B. Kates) seems like he's out in left field, out of touch with reality.  He actually stated, for example, that now that the Democrats are in control of Congress again after 12 years, the Obama administration would _not_ attack gun rights because they had more important issues on their agenda; yet Obama is underhandedly trying to ban guns through the back door, via proposed ""anti gun trafficking"" treaties with the UN and other unscrupulous means (including the threat of doing so through Executive Order!).  Assinine statements like that from a bona fide gun rights expert and legal authority makes you wonder what goes through his head sometimes.<br /><br />Another criticism of ""Handguns"" is that they don't seem to review very many ""budget"" guns in their magazine.  Not surprising, I suppose, because they do have to appease their big-buck advertisers, right?  Which is also why you'll seldom (if ever) find a bad review of a model from a big-name manufacturer.  Regardless, I'd like to see this publication become monthly again (they tried for a time), but I suppose it's kind of difficult to fill the pages on a monthly basis.  [So take note: your 1yr subscription is for 6 issues only, not 12.]<br /><br />Nevertheless, as I said, this is a wonderful publication for the handgun enthusiast.  I've only missed one issue since cancelling my subscription, and honestly I already miss it!

The articles are solid and never fluffy, unlike a lot of magazines targeted at a primarily female audience. I remember several of my favorite articles: couture sewing vs. regular sewing, how to deal with common fitting issues, and how to preserve old garments. Although I am an inexperienced sewer I feel that the information in the magazine is also useful for more intermediate or even advanced sewers.",[],B000063XJP,B000063XJP,AG2MYIFT3R6QCUGQK34EEZP3OXHA,2011-06-06 05:55:47.000,0,False

1,Not What I Expected,"I subscribed to this magazine (Brio) on behalf of my 13 year old step-daughter so that she would have an age-appropriate magazine that would foster a more Christian view of her world.  The cover and first few pages were OK.  Loved the ""ad"" about reconnecting with your mom because ""You have more in common than your DNA.""  Pictures and format were well done.  The contents page looked inviting,too. Then to the nitty-gritty.  The ""Inbox,"" which contains feedback from readers, got my attention first.  In the middle of the page is a note from a 15 year old girl entitled, ""God Talks to Me.""  OK, well, he 'speaks' to all of us, but this was different.  She states ""God has told me that America is like the biblical Israel, and we're going to be destroyed if we don't turn from our sins.  We've already been warned enough through 9/11 and Katrina."" Incredulously, there was absolutely no reply or note of any sort from the editors.  That the staff would condone the idea that disasters befall people because they (or we) deserve them surprised me and is just not the message I want to impart to my child. But, instead of suggesting something that may actually be helpful to the writer, the editorial staff reinforced this view by their complicity.  As I continued not so casually perusing the rest of the magazine, I found more off-kilter expressions of devotion in all of the articles that related to God and religion.  The articles that were not religiously oriented were quite good (on hygiene, IQ, etc.), but were of the sort that one can find in any girl's magazine. In the end, I cancelled my subscription.  And, although I ordered this mag through Amazon.com, Brio's ""Specialty Department"" told me that I could not get a refund because somehow I had subscribed through a ""fundraiser,"" and they (the publishers, Focus on the Family) did not have my money.<br /><br />Well, in the end, LESSON LEARNED!

""Drop 10 pounds in two weeks with our new plan"" ""Walk Off Belly Fat with our New Plan"" ""Defy Your Age"" etc. etc. etc.  If you want, subscribe for a year and then save your money by not renewing.  You won't miss much new stuff.<br />2.  Prevention has gone from a magazine promoting the prevention of disease with natural choices to promoting cures with the latest drugs.<br />3.  Once you subscribe to a Rodale publication you will be inundated with offers for their latest and best ever diet plan books.  They manage to find the ""real"" secret to quick and permanent weight loss with amazing frequency and regularity.  I used to subscribe to Prevention and Organic Gardening and Runner's World but I now avoid any Rodale publication.<br />4.  Prevention is too quick to jump on the latest bandwagon regarding healthy eating.  Over the years it has gone from proclaiming that people shouldn't get more than 10-15% of their calories from protein to recommending 3x that amount, from declaring that you shouldn't eat carrots (high glycemic value) or egg yolks (cholesterol) or white potatoes (no food value), etc. to declaring that these are super foods, from promoting the consumption of minimal fats to the near worship of MUFAs. I know that first and foremost Rodale is a big business, and its main interest is getting people to buy its books and magazines, but I believe Prevention has fueled the hysteria over bad and good foods that the general population misinterprets.<br /><br />Prevention has many good points and articles, but I no longer find it worth my time or money.",[],B00005NIOO,B00005NIOO,AHVFQQSUVJZPBWUZI4DM2QSMX5EA,2009-10-27 17:04:29.000,14,False

This rag is no better than a cheap tabloid from the early 80's, long before the world had the internet to fuel it's absurd gossip and Hollywood's unending, shallow self-promotion.  This wasn't even worth flipping through, just to look at the pictures.  We still thumb through every issue, for the occasional celebrity interview, which are usually just as disappointing as the rest of the printed skits.  But after only a couple months we already practically dread getting this in the mail every week, knowing it'll likely be a complete waste of time, if not an upsetting one, as this tabloid's approach to reporting on entertainment is most often as shallow and vainly self-promotional as the industry it's reporting on.

Rolling Stone, please return to being a magazine which provides us with phenomenal coverage and thoughtful analysis of so many of the most world disrupting and history making events, while also provoking our thoughts about music and other arts, which provide us with joy to counter the grim reality of the world as it is (and as Rolling Stone's reliably thought provoking and rigorously competent journalists have dependably served up to us).

Apart from these interviews, a fabulous article was written, filling us in on tidbits.  The article was spectacular so say the least.  It was awesome!  This show was hilarious, and we really miss it.  The brilliant acting, the chemistry between these veteran actors, the timing and the writing, all made it quite magical!  Oh, an let's not forget Eddie the dog!  Ha!  It was a treat.  The article was awesome.  Way to God, EW!  BRAVO!",[],B00G16YQT8,B00G16YQT8,AFLBL2YDTUIU46GNB7DEIJ7WWO7A,2013-11-16 15:24:25.000,1,True

3,Fast food and headline news for the runner,"If you like the &quot;quick and dirty&quot; format that is conducive to a busy lifestyle, you'll like this magazine.

A recent example mentioned a faster recovery from long runs.  Sounds great.  At the age of 49, I'm up for anything that helps with recovering from a 20 miler.  The &quot;article&quot; was a couple of paragraphs on soaking yourself in an ice bath.  It even suggested biting on a towel so you don't wake the neighbors!<br />If you're the type who would rather run by a fast food restaurant than cook dinner, or prefer CNN's Headline News format to their &quot;regular&quot; news because you don't want to be bothered with all the extraneous discussions, you'll like Runner's World.

1,Turned to crooks,"Very dishonest business. They use your email address and sell it to the worst spammers and crooks in the market. I tried them in 2011 and gave them my hotmail account. I noticed an uptick in spam emails but I couldn't confirm that it was IBD because I used to get few spams every week. This year, I gave them my gmail account, and I went from 0 spam email to several tens of spam email everyday. They were the only ones I gave my gmail email, no confusion here. I called and the rep didn't deny it, he said he would tell his supervisor to take me off the list. It's too late since it is already in all of the spammers chat rooms. Now, one mistake from my part and all of my accounts are at risk because of them.<br /><br />Now, let me ask everyone one question: would you trust IBD with your money in following their recommendations while you can't trust them with your email account? It seems like they can't make enough money from selling their products, so they sell your email account to crooks.<br />Obviously I canceled my subscription and I will never deal with them again.<br />Beware of these crooks.

Another reviewer was 'outraged' about the nudity in the olympic history issue. I find her reaction a tad &#34;outrageous&#34;. First of all it lists the ages from 9-14. I came from a SUPER conservative and &#34;tight lipped&#34; on the whole birds and bees issue family. Nobody talked about anything, everything was taboo....it all resulted in me feeling pretty uncomfortable and ashamed of myself.

There's nude statues everywhere. Get a grip! Everybody has a body, no need to make your kids feel the way I did. I would go so far to say that was my parents BIGGEST parenting mistake.

4,The Car Magazine for the Racing Circuit Guy,"Bottom-line: Within its 130 or so glossy pages I have found a home, a resting place from which I can gleam my needed automotive knowledge.<br /><br />Like a lot of middle-aged men I am a car guy.  I eat and drink--more or less--the elixir of horsepower, torque, RPM's, painted wheels, ergonomic cockpits, and colored sheet metal.  I can recite long lists of carlines and their varying specifications.  At various times in the last five years I have subscribed to and devoured three of the nation's most popular car magazines: Motor Trend, Automobile, and Car & Driver.  But, I recently gave up my subscription to Automobile and received a $5.00 off coupon from Magazines.com via e-mail; I replaced it with ""Road & Track Magazine,"" published monthly by Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S., Inc.<br /><br />Like most car magazines, ""Road & Track Magazine"" is full of glossy, colorful, pictures and serious well written articles, car comparisons, and long-term road tests, but the magazine has little to distinguish itself from its brethren.  I used to read ""Road & Track Magazine"" back in my twenties, and while the magazine has moved itself smartly into the 21st century, the basic formula that made the magazine fun and informative back in the 1980's remains virtually unchanged.<br /><br />""Road & Track Magazine"" does an excellent job of covering the national (American) and International car scene. And the reaches far-a-field to bring readers the off-beat, the exotic and the really expensive, but fear not the Chevrolet Volt's, Suzuki Swift's and Toyota Corolla's of the world also find a place inside the glossy pages of ""Road & Track Magazine.""  And the magazine does this is in a format that is easy to follow and extremely inviting.<br /><br />For instance in the June 2010 issue ""Road & Track Magazine"" featured the previews/road tests of the following cars: Jaguar XJ, Audi R8 Spyder; Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 vs. Nissan GTR vs. Porsche 911 Turbo; plus a long-term test wrap-up of the Acura TL SH-AWD, as well as a features write-up on the Suzuki Swift, Mazda Demio, and Toyota iQ.  Add to these two very well written and equally as comprehensive competition articles: Electric Boogaloo -Tesla vs. Lotus, and Formula 1, Then & Now, and you have receipt for the most useful automobile magazine in the country.<br /><br />Because of its name ""Road & Track Magazine"" does seem to cover the racing circuit more than it fellows, which would be fine if I followed Formula 1, NASCAR, and notable figures from that world, but I don't so I tend to skip over those articles.<br /><br />Interspersed between these nuggets of auto knowledge are other articles that deal with esoteric but informative tidbits from the automotive arena.  For instance the same issue that brought us the above mentioned articles offered up an excellent 2-page article on the past, present and future of the spark plug!  Not exactly need to know information, but for anyone with a keen interest in the internal combustion engine--like me--this article hit the spot.<br /><br />When the final page is turned is ""Road & Track Magazine"" different enough from the other two car periodicals I read to renew my subscription?  In a word: no.  While I certainly enjoy reading the magazines various articles and columns there just isn't enough between the glossy covers to justify renewing the subscription.  I'm just not into the auto racing scene and ""Road & Track Magazine"" is big into Formula 1, NASCAR and other racing related themes.<br /><br />For raw, general automotive new ""Road & Track Magazine"" is not as good as Motor Trend, Automobile, or Car & Driver.  But with a subscription cost of only $9.97 (or less, over at Magazines.com) per year, you can afford to grab 12 issues and make up your own mind.",[],B002PXVYO6,B002PXVYO6,AFFGVUW7BAFT7ZL7ZMG5RKESG5XA,2010-12-16 00:57:12.000,21,False
4,The Discerning and Intellectual Cook's Magazine of Choice,"Bottom-Line: If you are looking for a magazine written for the not-so-average Joe, ""Men's Journal Magazine"" might be for you.<br /><br />The world of Men's magazines, or magazines that are marketed towards a certain portion of the male reading populace, is littered with twaddle that only seems to appeal to the baser instincts of the male gender.  You know the magazines; they need not be mentioned here.  Some are happily folding tent never to heard from again.  Truth be told there are very few magazines that appeal to the more intellectual side of a man (yes ladies we do have such a side).<br /><br />But recently as ""special gift"" for renewing my Bally's Total Fitness membership I received a 1 year subscription to ""Men's Journal Magazine"", ""a general interest, active lifestyle magazine with a focus on adventure, travel, equipment, sports, fitness, health, and style.""<br /><br />""Men's Journal Magazine"", is published monthly by Wenner Media, the same publishing house that brings us such notable sidewalk fare as Us Weekly and Rolling Stone.  The magazine will set you back $3.95 an issue at the local newsstand, but 1 year subscriptions can be had for $9.95.  Inside each approximately 120-page magazine you will not find half clothed women dripping with sexy come hither stares.  Nor will you find the next Hollywood ""it"" girl, or wannabe skinny model with a fake tan gracing the pages of this Men's magazine.  No, ""Men's Journal"" is serious business folks; vapid men with one track minds and adolescent libido's need not apply!<br /><br />""Men's Journal"" is a smartly written, thoughtfully designed magazine for the active intellectual male.  The magazine offer feature-length articles on a wide range of subjects based on the magazine's central theme: adventure, travel, equipment, sports, fitness, health, and style.<br /><br />However, like most magazines in America, ""Men's Journal"" depends heavily on advertising to generate revenue, but unlike fashion magazines that seem to be 90% advertising and 10% substance, ""Men's Journal"" only dedicates every other page to colorful spreads bent on selling us stuff we don't really need, or in some cases don't need but really, really want, but can't afford.  To its credit, most of the advertising is not dedicated to men's fashions, wore by young impeccably sculpted and groomed men, or automobiles that are impossibly expensive, but instead to the business of adventure and sports.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />When all is said and done I enjoy reading ""Men's Journal Magazine.""  Granted, given my current lifestyle (my days of adventures have been traded in for the American Dream and all that entails for now), the information the magazine imparts is only marginally useful to me.  The fitness articles are rater short and are mostly how-to's that while useful are just barely so.  Most of the equipment discussed in Men's Journal is for the magazines target audience with the appropriate disposable income; that's not me.<br /><br />Nonetheless, when my subscription runs out in another ten months I will probably renew.  Why?  Because ""Men's Journal"" represents my kind of man: thoughtful, intelligent, adventurous (hey, I used to ride submarines, hike mountains and scuba dive and I still want to go sky-diving), man who actually appreciates full-length feature articles or two written by grown-ups for grown-ups.<br /><br />If you are looking for a magazine written for the not-so-average Joe, filled with those little tidbits in life only men can appreciate, but also brings a healthy infusion of intelligent to its well written and information pages, ""Men's Journal Magazine"" might be for you.",[],B002LDA9VY,B002LDA9VY,AFFGVUW7BAFT7ZL7ZMG5RKESG5XA,2010-12-16 00:37:52.000,19,False
4,The Car Magazine for the Everyman,"Bottom-line: Within its 130 or so glossy pages I have found a home, a resting place from which I can gleam my needed automotive knowledge.<br /><br />Like most men in their twenties I was a car guy.  I ate and drank the elixir of horsepower, torque, RPM's, and colored sheet metal.  I could recite long lists of carlines and their varying specifications.  I subscribed to and devoured all of the (four) the nation's most popular car magazines of the time: ""Car & Driver,"" Motor Trend, Road & Track, and the beauty queen of them all, Automobile Magazine.  But as time and overseas assignments took my attention elsewhere, one-by-one my subscriptions lapsed and my car fetish all but died.<br /><br />But, now in the autumn of my life, I have rekindled my love of cars, especially expensive high performance mid-sized cars from well-known and well respected nameplates we all know: Cadillac, BMW, Audi, Lexus, Lincoln, Jaguar, and of course Mercedes-Benz.  So when I got a $5.00 off coupon from Magazines.com via e-mail, I plowed through the 230 or so men's magazines before finally deciding on ""Car & Driver Magazine"" published monthly by Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S., Inc.<br /><br />Like most car magazines, ""Car & Driver"" is full of glossy, colorful, pictures and serious well written articles, car comparisons, and long-term road tests, but the magazine offers so much more.  Unlike the other automobile periodicals, ""Car & Driver"" serves up truly useful (practical) information for the everyman, or woman.  This subtle distinction elevates ""Car & Driver"" above the rest and makes it far and away the best car rag for my hard earned money.<br /><br />However, like other three American car magazines ""Car & Driver"" covers a broad swath of the American automobile scene, but it also does a fair job of delving into the international automobile scene as well.  And the reaches far-a-field to bring readers the off-beat, the exotic and the really expensive, but fear not the Chevrolet Aveo's of this world also find a place inside the glossy pages of ""Car & Driver"" magazine.  And the magazine does this is a format that is easy to follow and extremely inviting.<br /><br />For instance in the October 2008 issue ""Car & Driver"" featured the previews/road tests of the following cars: Acura ZDX, Alfa 8C Spider, 2011 BMW X1, Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG, 2010 Ford Shelby Mustang GT500 Convertible, 2009 Pontiac G8 GXP, plus a comprehensive write-up on The Best Cars for $20,000.  Add to these two very well written and equally as comprehensive comparison article: Audi R8 V-10 vs. Ferrari 430 Scuderia, and you have receipt for the most useful automobile magazine this side of the pond.<br /><br />Another strong incentive to read ""Car & Driver"" is its decided lack of wall-to-wall advertisements.  Most of the magazine is dedicated to substance; the articles are what make ""Car & Driver"" such a joy to read.  The articles are well written, concise, and comprehensive.  And although the writers fill the paragraphs with lexicon of the automobile industry, the prose never talks down to the reader, or looses my interest along the way.<br /><br />Another way ""Car & Driver"" distinguishes itself from the rest, is its more than comprehensive write-up on each automobile within the magazine.  Even the shortest articles, or write-up's feature a detailed description of the car, its interior and exterior specifications, road test results, pricing, and possible competitors.  No other magazine that I have read thus far--Automobile, Motor Trend, or Road & Track--offers as much useful information.<br /><br />Interspersed between these nuggets of auto knowledge are other articles that deal with esoteric but informative tidbits from the automotive arena.  For instance the same issue that brought us the above mentioned articles offered up a 6-page article on a WWII era Jeep!  Not exactly need to know information, but human interest stories are always welcome in this world seemingly filled with nothing by death and mayhem.<br /><br />Even some of the photographs in ""Car & Driver Magazine"" have a story to tell in the guise of in-depth exterior and mechanical analysis.  In the final analysis there is no other car magazine I would rather subscribe to than ""Car & Driver Magazine.""  Within its 130 or so glossy pages I have found a home, a resting place from which I can gleam my needed automotive knowledge.  For me there is no other Car Mag!",[],B002PXVYBE,B002PXVYBE,AFFGVUW7BAFT7ZL7ZMG5RKESG5XA,2010-12-16 00:31:38.000,2,False
4,Little Nuggets of Information I Find Useful,"Bottom-line: Popular Science is my new personal science and technology advisor designed to enrich my knowledge of science and technology spanning the globe.<br /><br />I have always delved into the minutia of how things work.  This natural curiosity grew from, where I don't know where it comes from exactly.  Perhaps it part of the male brain, or perhaps just part of mine; I like to take things apart and see how they work.  It's not enough to know that if I pay my electric bill on time, when I flick on a light switch I will have light; I want to know how the electricity is generated and how it got to the switch.  That same curiosity led me to my current profession as an Information Technology professional.  What started out as a hobby, a need to know how computers worked, has turned into a second career for me.<br /><br />All of this explains why I subscribe to and read Popular Science Magazine [...], whose slogan is The Future Is Now.  As magazines go, Popular Science is a pretty thin rag, but that does not mean the monthly is not packed with all manner of useful and informative information.  it does mean that the magazine is not (over) burdened with page after page of annoying advertising.  There is of course advertising, a magazine could not survive without it, but is it not overly intrusive and overbearing.<br /><br />Regular sections in the magazine include:<br /><br />o Features: feature length articles;<br />o Megapixels<br />o What's New<br />o Headlines<br />o How 2.0<br />o FYI<br />o Other Stuff: includes Letters, and editor's note.<br /><br />My favorite section is What's New; I tend to read it first every month.  Each section is filled with six or seven pages of text and illustrations one the latest and greatest new products and prototypes from across the world in the science, general technology and astronomy fields. The latest issue featured a big bold article on the future of police equipment, called Cop Tech; Inside The Police R&R Lab. A flashy title to be sure, but is backed up with quality writing as well as pictures and or images of the equipment and gadgets discussed in the article.<br /><br />Other articles in this month's (February 2007) magazine include:<br /><br />o Protect Everything; the future of personal security.<br />o Journey From The Center of The Earth; Popsci Innovator<br />o It Came From The Lab; Uncommon Knowledge<br />o Fly The Friendly Seas; Concepts & Prototypes<br /><br />The articles for the most part are well written, concise, and comprehensive.  Aside from the feature articles, the most informative portion of the magazine are the one or two page explanation features wherein some present or future gadget is explained, usually accompanied by an illustration.  For example on page 27 of this month's issue under the Headlines section the magazine explains in great detail--complete with illustration--how the Department of Energy is building a greener coal plant, that will extract Hydrogen--called Syngas--from water and use it to produce electricity.  The coal is used in the process and the Carbon it creates as a by-product is pumped underground into a saline solution.  The item was short, but came away from it with a thorough understanding of a process I had heretofore never heard of.<br /><br />I have only one minor quibble with the magazine: almost one third of the back half of the monthly is given over to adverting.  Not the expensive glossy, glamorous kind, but the shady little, not so sure you can thrust what their advertising kind found is too many other wise respectable magazines.<br /><br />Subscriptions<br /><br />Popular Science Magazine is published by Time 4 Media. In addition to the English language edition, Popular Science is also published in China, Israel, Korea and Mexico. Book shelf sells for a cover price of $3.99 US, Canada $4.99, while a 12-month subscription will set you back $15.95 and a 24-month subscription checks in at 21.95. If you are doing the math--and you should--that's a 77% saving off the single copy price. You might be able to find a better deal at one of the on-line magazine subscription sites like Magazines.com, or e-Subscription.com.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Other than that one decidedly minor quibble, I have no qualms recommending Popular Science to anyone who asks.  The magazine is my new personal science and technology advisor designed to enrich my knowledge of science and technology spanning the globe.",[],B002CT515Q,B002CT515Q,AFFGVUW7BAFT7ZL7ZMG5RKESG5XA,2010-12-15 01:17:49.000,0,False
3,A Large Advertisement Magazine with Interview Thrown In Just Because,"Bottom-Line: I subscribe to ""Interview Magazine"" but I will not be renewing my subscription.<br /><br />I have been making a conscience effort of late to expand my horizons, to get out of (magazine reading) comfort zone.  To that end I have cast my reading net out from the usual news rag, and started reading a new diverse set of magazines, including Esquire, Ebony, Business Week, US, People, Popular Science, Jet, Car & Driver, Essence, Laptop Magazine, Travel & Leisure, Cooks, and ""Interview Magazine"", just to name a few.<br /><br />For a person like me who usually frequents the aforementioned news magazines, ""Interview Magazine"" is like a culture shock.  First off the magazine is large; larger in fact than any magazine you might find on the newsstand or in the local chain book store with the exception of Rolling Stone.  Second the magazine is printed on thick paper stock, which has a gritty feel to it; say good-bye to glossy and hello to matte and muted colors.<br /><br />""Interview Magazine"" features advertisements, wall to wall advertisements; the interviews with up-and-coming and established celebrities interspersed throughout the pages of the magazine seem almost coincidental.  I am currently reading the April 2007 issue, with a large inviting picture of Liv Tyler on the front cover.  To the magazines credit it does try and cover the full spectrum of entertainment from fashion to music, from art to the movies and places in between.<br /><br />Most of the interviews--especially those done on up-and-coming stars and starlet's--are mere snapshots of the persons personal and or professional life; there is little sink my proverbial intellectual, or even mildly interested teeth into.  There is just enough there to try and goad me into find out more.  The in-depth interviews are a lot more fulfilling; most of these are done by other celebrities; for instance in this issue Rose McGowan is interviewed by Quentin Tarantino, and Liza Minnelli interviewed musician Gerald Way.  Past issue have followed this same formula, with mostly good results, meaning I have enjoyed the interviews and images.<br /><br />But the one huge downside to ""Interview Magazine"" is its slavish devotion to advertising.  In fact the first 50 pages of this issue are devoted to wall-to-wall cutting edge, youth-inspired clothing and fragrance advertising.  The masthead of the magazine is stuck somewhere with this advertising soup, but the table of contents did not show up until one third of the magazine was leafed through--very annoying!  Not only that, but every celebrity image was accompanied by a solid paragraph on who made what they were wearing, who styled their hair, who did their make-up, and incredibly, what fragrance they happened to be wearing during the shoot!<br /><br />Is this an example of advertising run amok, or am I being far too sensitive and demanding in wanting ""Interview Magazine"" to at least be a magazine and not a run-on poster board for the chic and impossibly unfettered youth of America (New York City) and Europe is wearing?  But so many magazines follow this advertisement-on-every-page formula; is this the new norm, and should I get used to it?<br /><br />I could in ""Interview Magazine's"" case if most of the writing were not so rushed and devoid of substance.  This is something I alluded to above; sound-bites have their place, but not inside the covers of a magazine name ""Interview Magazine"", where I at least expect to learn something more about an artist than where they were discovered, their age, or how often they frequent Starbucks.  It's called substance and ""Interview Magazine"" just doesn't have enough to justify its larger than life existence.<br /><br />I subscribe to ""Interview Magazine"" but I will not be renewing my subscription; in this case my bid to broaden my horizons found a mostly vapid landscape full of wasted paper, muted colors, and questionable prose.",[],B00005N7NY,B00005N7NY,AFFGVUW7BAFT7ZL7ZMG5RKESG5XA,2010-12-14 01:14:20.000,1,False
4,The Poets Magazine For Readers of Poetry,"Bottom-Line: The asking price for subscription is steep but ""Poetry Magazine"" is well worth the asking price.<br /><br />When I first started writing poetry, I did so as a cathartic release, a soul cleansing exercise I needed to survive a very trying time in my life.  Somewhere along to 100th poem I became convinced that I just had to be published in order feel like a real poet.  And so I started visiting on-line writing sites and posting my poetry there in hopes of being discovered.  So much for that!  But I did hear about a periodical called ""Poetry Magazine"" a publication that could help me hone my craft, improve my presentation and style, and well, get published.<br /><br />""Poetry Magazine""--a for-profit periodical--is published twelve times per year, by the Poetry Foundation, which is ""an independent literary organization committed to a vigorous presence for poetry in our culture. It exists to discover and celebrate the best poetry and to place it before the largest possible audience.""  The magazine was founded in Chicago in 1912 by Harriet Monroe making Poetry Magazine the oldest monthly ""devoted to verse in the English-speaking world."" Poetry Magazine's stated mission is ""to print the best poetry written today, in whatever style, genre, or approach.""  The magazine quickly established its reputation by publishing such notable poets as T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens, H. D., William Carlos Williams, Carl Sandburg. As well as other well know and now celebrated poets.<br /><br />Individual issues cost $3.75/U.S., $5.00 CAN, with a yearly subscription running $35.00 /$46.00 CAN, for a year; International subscriptions cost $46.00.  I have had a subscription off and on for the past five years; it's on again.<br /><br />""Poetry Magazine"" is a publication for poets (and those who enjoy poetry) featuring the works of other poets. ""Poetry Magazine"" is not really a magazine about the art of writing poetry itself, but instead concentrates on publishing poetry of new and established poets.  Do not open its mostly black and white print pages and expect articles about how to market your efforts or an in-depth analysis on how to write the perfect short story or craft the quintessential poem, you'll be disappointed.  What you will find is a fairly unadorned little magazine that at most features as many as four poets at a time, publishing poems and or short stories by the authors.  In other words, ""Poetry Magazine"" is strictly a reader magazine with most of its number pages devoted to the written word.<br /><br />Some of the authors featured in the magazine are well known while others I have never head of before, but all make for a compelling read.  I have to admit that I do not always read all of the poems, some are a little non-traditional for my tastes; instead I tend to skim the magazine and pick out interesting poems or short stories that speak to me.<br /><br />""Poetry Magazine"" is a thin volume with very few of its pages devoted to advertising of any sort.  The magazine reminds me more of a book than a magazine mostly because of its unconventional size and format.  The poems start right after the Table of Content and flow uninterrupted until the advertising/ announcements section, which only take up the last eight to ten pages of the typical magazine.<br /><br />The only color you'll find in ""Poetry Magazine"" is on the cover, the rest of the magazine is printed in black and white.  I supposed this to under-gird the magazine serious nature.  ""Poetry Magazine"" is not a large tome, checking in at around 120 pages per issue.<br /><br />In the final analysis I keep coming back to ""Poetry Magazine"" because the content is germane to where I'm at in my life right now.  And because the magazine is small and I can usually get through an issue in a couple of nights.

4,The Intellectual Man's Magazine of Choice?,"Bottom-Line: When all is said and done I have to admit that I enjoy reading ""Esquire Magazine;"" who knows the magazine just might make me a better man!<br /><br />The world of men's magazines is festooned with glossy covers adorned with half dressed woman and mostly vapid content geared toward the more Neanderthal and or juvenile among us.  In a world filled with Maxim and Stuff magazines, ""Esquire"" magazine stands out as a periodical with substance, style and intellect, but at the same time is not afraid to feature a beautiful woman on the cover and within it glossy folds.<br /><br />""Esquire Magazine,"" whose tag line is Man at His Best, was founded in 1933 and is published monthly by the venerable Hearst Corporation.  The magazine has a long history of featuring noted authors of their day, including Malcolm Muggeridge, William F. Buckley, and Truman Capote among other notables.<br /><br />However, ""Esquire Magazine"" is known and has been known as much for its artsy cover designs as its high-brow content and had given birth to a few notable art designer careers.  To this date the cover of ""Esquire,"" remains a work of art with big bold colors, and larger than life personas framed by flowing text.  The covers alone rival another venerable men's magazine--Playboy--in style and sex appeal.  The only difference is that ""Esquire"" gives equal deference to men on its covers, though they--thankfully--are not shown in various stages of undress.<br /><br />""Esquire Magazine""--a monthly publication, is a striking combination of the trivial and useful information, from its (mostly) useless monthly column The Guide to Sex to the interesting 10 Things You Don't Know about Women, written by a different female celeb, which I find somewhat useful.  The first third of the magazine is devoted to these little nuggets of information designed to help craft a better man.<br /><br />In addition to the monthly Features section, Esquire also includes a rather lengthy and engaged celebrity interview; this month it is Angelina Jolie, two months ago it was the delectable Halle Barry.  Some might find these sort of celeb-driven interview trite, given the massive print and video coverage already afforded far too many so-call celebrities, but there is something to be learned from the oft-candid gab-fests with the stars.<br /><br />But, ""Esquire Magazine"" because it is a men's magazine, does pay homage to barely dressed, well crafted (meaning air-brushed) women within it covers, just not so many as, say Maxim or Stuff, but they are well represented.  And ""Esquire Magazine"" in not above objectifying women as its yearly Sexist Woman Alive anointment clearly shows.  The reigning queen Scarlett Johansson is set to give up her crown soon to a new winner, so the magazine has started drooping clues as to who the next winner will be; it is up to us to figure out who before the moniker is bestowed upon another blonde-haired, blue eyed American beauty; women of color need not apply it seems.<br /><br />However, If the two latter magazines take the stance that the way to a man's mind it through his eyeballs and groin, ""Esquire Magazine"" appeals to a higher sensibility hinting that men might just learn a thing or two from the fairer sex, thus elevating the intellectual discourse between the genders.<br /><br />And great writing is still at the forefront of the magazines agenda.  If the first third of the rag is dedicated to the snippet, the later half is devoted to lengthy articles, with little or no commercial interruption (YES!).  Excerpts from novels written by both males and females find a home within ""Esquire Magazine"".  And authors, both known and unknown grace the pages.<br /><br />But there are investigative articles as well, which I less compelling but, but welcome nonetheless.  A recent article featured a man who is now in charge of security at a major nuclear power plant in the U.S. who used to work for Blackwater as a paid gun for hire.  The article portrays the man as something more than a macho ape with a gun for hire; he is given a decidedly human face and heart, which I found oddly engaging.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />When all is said and done I have to admit that I enjoy reading ""Esquire Magazine"".  When I first picked one up years ago I was convinced that there was nothing for me within its (somewhat) high brow pages, but I have come to enjoy the magazines style and substance, though I must admit that most of the advertising is not designed for someone of my limited financial station; yes I make a good living, but little of my current income is disposable enough to by a $500.00 wrist watch even if I wore them, which I don't.<br /><br />But if you are banned (for whatever reason) from reading the quintessential male magazine, Playboy, ""Esquire Magazine"" comes in close second, followed by GQ.  If you are looking for a magazine written for the not-so-average Joe, filled with those little tidbits in life only men can appreciate, but also brings a healthy infusion of intelligent to its well written and information pages, Esquire Magazine might be for you.  Now that I have started my subscription ($10.00 for a year from Magazines.com), I doubt I will let it lapse, it is turning out to be just that good. And who knows ""Esquire Magazine"" just might make me a better man!",[],B001THPA3K,B001THPA3K,AFFGVUW7BAFT7ZL7ZMG5RKESG5XA,2010-12-13 03:14:13.000,5,False

With so much information available, particularly from online sources, it is probably unrealistic to expect much more from a magazine.<br /><br />Digital photography involves so much more than just cameras, lenses and studio lighting, and it is easy to miss developments we are not specifically looking for.  Not everything will be relevant, but Shutterbug often covers subjects of general interest that may prove to be of value, regardless of the brand of camera you use.<br /><br />Shutterbug's test reports review a variety of products, usually covering many of the key points, and providing a reasonable analysis.  A periodical dependent on advertisers, will seldom emphasize the negatives about a product, so consumers should be prepared to do further research.  Shutterbug definitely has a ton of advertising, but less now than in the past when the magazine was the size of a small phone book.

4,Perhaps the Best of the General Science Magazines,"There are or have been a fair number of ‘science’ magazines — magazines devoted to general science and technology, written for an audience most of whom will not have an expert background in most of the major fields covered.  Unfortunately, most of them are written not so much to convey some understanding of their ostensible topics as to give the reader the impression that he or she has been informed. (In high school, we called essays and papers written that way ‘B.S.’)<br /><br />American Scientist (not to be confused with Scientific American) is one of the exceptions.  It began and remains a house organ of Sigma Xi (a society of scientists and engineers), and is written as if on the assumption that the readership has a strong background in some science, if not necessarily in the specific science of a given article. (You can sample some of the articles by going to www.americanscientist.org .)<br /><br />One deficiency that this magazine shares with every other general magazine that I have read is that, when the relationship of science or technology to social policy is discussed, the authors usually make unquestioned technocratic assumptions of one sort or of another (presuming that administrated solutions will necessarily be at least as good and usually better than those of any other sort), and are also inclined to insist (as if it is just obvious to all Right-Thinking people) that the marginal value of satisfying scientific curiosity outweighs that of rival concerns.",[],B00006K3EU,B00006K3EU,AFA4WDHIDNOMU6PWAGIMONFVTXGA,2013-06-26 09:52:13.000,24,True

2,Not very useful reviews,"I'm a longtime audiophile, and the main reason I subscribe to these publications is for informative reviews of interesting equipment and/or of equipment I might want to purchase.  While TAS does review a lot of equipment I'm interested in, the reviews themselves are next to useless for my needs.  As a former reviewer myself, I often find the most helpful parts of an in depth review to be where a review compares the component under review to other competitors in the same category.  As humans -- and yes, believe it or not reviewers are human -- we are good at judging things compared to something else but are notoriously poor at judging things on their own.  For example, I would always start reviewing a piece of audio equipment by listening to it for many hours and with many different types of music until I thought I had its characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses pretty well in hand.  But in just about every case, when I then compared that component to a competitive product, the opinions I thought I had pretty much had nailed down almost invariably changed.  And most times those changes were critically significant and not small.  Had I not taken the time to compare a review component to something else I would have in fact written an erroneous and even potentially a misleading review.<br /><br />Bringing this back to TAS reviews, they very rarely bother to compare any component under review to anything else.  And on top of that, the reviewers almost always fail to list the corresponding component in their own reference system so we don't even have an idea of what their frame of reference is for the review.  Sometimes they don't even bother to list any components in their reference system at all!  At the very least, this calls into serious question the validity of any conclusions or recommendations made in these reviews.  Just hearing what a reviewer ""thinks"" a piece of equipment sounds like by just listening to it on its own, and for the reasons stated above, is basically useless to me as a reader and potential customer.  This begs the question -- why do TAS reviewers consistently refuse to make product comparisons or disclose the corresponding equipment in their reference system?  Well, as a former reviewer myself I can tell you it makes reviewing equipment a whole lot easier and quicker when you don't have to bother with all that pesky due diligence.  It also largely frees the reviewer from virtually any level of accountability for their written conclusions as it's tough to take someone's assertions to task when they're made in a self-protective reviewing bubble.  How nice it must be to review products for TAS!  I actually called out one of their reviewers on this in an email after reading one of his many mostly useless reviews.  He responded that he didn't have a comparable piece to compare the review component to, and even if he did it's unlikely a reader would have that component in their own system.  I can say that with my former publication if we didn't have at least a somewhat comparable piece of equipment in house for comparison we didn't get to review that component.  Period.  It was also mandatory that all our reviews include a ""comparison"" section for all the good reasons I raised earlier.  Most of the reviews you read from Stereophile and all the reviews from the Soundstage! review site contain at least some form of comparison, and both those publications also take the time, effort, and expense to measure the specs of review components and publish them so readers have even more useful and credible information to help them formulate their own assessments.  They also serve to add another level of accountability on a reviewer as the measurements should largely jibe with their listening impressions.  And the second excuse that a reader is unlikely to have the product used for comparison in their system is absolute hogwash.  Many of us have heard lots of equipment and/or read other, and probably more useful, reviews of that product so we at least have an idea of its salient relative performance characteristics and sound.<br /><br />So I subscribe to TAS ONLY because they ""review"" equipment I tend to be interested in and like to read about, but sadly I almost never finish a TAS review feeling that I have a good idea of what a given piece of equipment actually sounds like.  And, after all, isn't that the main point of reading a review in the first place?  Sad.  Just sad.",[],B002PXVZ0O,B002PXVZ0O,AEA3W7UMR4LY564M2UUNIUHD5U2Q,2019-08-18 17:38:52.747,2,False

I think maybe it is that there is more advertising in it but the stories such do not seem to shine like they used to.

1,I think I may cancel,"I subscribed to this magazine for many years but it's not the same magazine. After spending a few minutes thumbing through the pages I found that it's way to political for me to waste money on ! I also noticed that it is catering to certain races, not all races. Shame on them ! For every Caucasian model there are 4 brown or black models. The articles are also prejudice toward your average heterosexual person.

5,One of my top 3 favorite publications,"I'm a home sewer who loves fashion forward clothing that is well-made and not super expensive. I first subscribed to this publication about 10 years ago.  This magazine is like getting a great fashion magazine with the patterns included instead of merely a pile of ads.<br /><br />It used to be harder to use the patterns in the English edition as they didn't include any of the detailed sewing instructions typical of an individually purchased sewing pattern, and the pattern markings were all in German. However, the current version includes helpful tips in every issue that over time will give a home sewer a good amount of technique for clothing construction and other projects.  You effectively get the value of more than $100 (USD) worth of patterns in every issue!  This edition includes mainly misses, some women's plus sizes and a few patterns for men and children in every issue.  They also have a &#34;plus&#34; edition in English which I also purchase as the regular issues are mainly filled with &#34;skinny&#34; sizes that quite a large percentage of American women cannot squeeze with our curves.  If you learn to redraft the patterns that must be traced anyway, this edition will give your far more original patterns for your money than the plus edition which seems to use 3 variations on the same basic pattern (shirt, dress, jacket for instance) and list it as if it is a completely different pattern instead of a typical pattern envelope that shows it as views A, B, C when only minimal style differences are done such as collar or hemline variations.<br /><br />This edition includes a few tall designs and a few petites as well.<br /><br />I'm still not a huge fan of the &#34;extra&#34; craft projects that are included like lampshades and other &#34;homemade&#34; looking things like decorating an old wine bottle or mirror.  There are many craft magazines and womens magazines that do that little craft stuff better and in more depth.  I wish they would take that out and include more sewing techniques or details about the individual garment patterns that are included or even another article about a designer or talented reader.",[],B0040VGZSG,B0040VGZSG,AFOKNKEXIXVUUSSQRDXJDWMSNWUQ,2014-01-22 06:43:41.000,43,True

1,Extremely Disappointed with National Geographic Kids,"My mother purchased this subscription for my son in the thought that it would be an educational publication. Upon receipt of the magazine, I was stunned by the layout and content. Rather than a version of their adult publication designed for the younger reader, it is a sensationalist ""pop culture"" oriented publication rife with advertisements targeting this demographic. I am not aware of whether another organization has merely licensed the National Geographic name, however I am canceling my subscription and attempting to find a more suitable magazine for my children. This is the last thing that I would want them to read.<br />One of the most egregious aspects of this magazine is that there are a significant number of two-page advertisement ""spreads"" that read as if they were educational materials. In the November 2010 issue for example, on pages 6-7, a large map of America is presented with colorful cartoons. Parents would begin reading this and showing states to their children, when suddenly they are struck by the fact that this is an ad for ""goldfishfun.com"" crackers, and the NBA. Page 12 is a full-page advertisement for a ""sneak peek at an exciting new novel"" along with an advertisement for the accompanying video game on page 13. Page 16-17 is another two-page ad spread for the AnimalJam video game. Pages 26-28 is a full-page ""story"" on the new Harry Potter movie. The back cover is an ad for borders.com.<br />This month's issue is no different, except this time the ads mostly focus on Nintendo DS game systems and Microsoft Kinect. I sincerely recommend that unless you are seeking another source of advertisement for your children, that you seek elsewhere for their educational content and the joy of having a magazine with their name on it arrive in the mail.

2,Excellent Amazon service; Crappy magazine,"First the Amazon service: It has been very good. I received the first issue 13 calendar days after ordering it, which is much faster than magazines I have ordered directly without going through Amazon. True this is a weekly magazine rather than a monthly one, but that is still good service. And with the exception of when the double issue came out (more on that later) I receive a new issue every week on either Saturday or Monday. The auto-renewal feature was easy enough to turn off through my Amazon profile. If you are wondering whether or not it is safe to subscribe to a magazine through Amazon, my experience has been more than satisfactory. I say go for it!<br /><br />Entertainment Weekly itself has gone downhill in the last decade. There used to be a good mix of TV, movies, and music. Now it is more than 90% television. My first issue was the aforementioned double issue. There was no issue the following week, which seems like the magazine editors' attempt to rip off their subscribers. The double issue was all television except for a few pages, but I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt because it was the special Fall preview TV issue. But the 2 issues since then have been hardly better. The average issue seems to have maybe 4 pages about movies, 2 pages about music, 2 pages about books, and the rest is all television. For someone who hardly ever watches TV, this is not very appealing. I do not include in that page count the cover stories/interviews, the last two of which have featured Neil Patrick Harris and Brad Pitt. At least the interviews are good. When they actually do review a movie I tend to completely disagree with their reviews.<br /><br />Entertainment Weekly has turned into nothing more than a glorified TV Guide. If you watch a lot of TV, then that may be what you want. But I don't watch much TV and want a more balanced entertainment package. As much as I hate Rolling Stone, they have been putting out a much better magazine than EW.<br /><br />EDIT: This is the second double issue in two months. Looks like EW just wants to rip off readers so they don't have to send an issue next week.",[],B005CAOGJO,B005CAOGJO,AE5SXFFFMGVOVGYJHV7FHZOXQUZA,2011-09-26 21:03:23.000,5,False

And no that doesn't mean I wear plastic glasses or own an iPhone- that means I read and understand real science articles (ex. Science magazine, arXiv.org).  In recent times I've even graduated past Scientific American, the real popular science magazine, because I'm usually ahead of that magazine. But don't let that scare you off! Having a geek review a science magazine is like having an auto mechanic tell you about car parts- listen to the guy who knows his stuff before taking advice from someone who doesn't know the subject who says it ""seems"" like a good thing.<br /><br />To go ahead and get the counter-argument out of the way, yes having Popular Science in the house is better than nothing. It's like a mechanic saying if you're not comfortable doing your own oil changes, at least clean your windows once in a while- you can do that at least. For a voracious reader, adding PopSci to your subscriptions is a fine way to pad out your reading and keep you from switching to tabloids or whatever else you might crave. But there are better options.<br /><br />Popular Science is borderline science fiction, sensationalizing random prototypes or trials in a field to always be ""the next big thing"". If one random billionaire investor somewhere in the Rockies has had a company custom build him a glider so he can dive off a mountain, then there's a ""trend"" and ""personal aviation may well be the transportation of the future"" or some such hype. It's good stuff for interesting little kids in science, when they can look at the fanciful designs and then run around the house going ""whoosh"" with their arms out. In fact, a great many of today's scientists grew up with starry-eyed vision of old issues of PopSci. But kids aren't the ones reading this magazine these days, as the adult-oriented advertising demonstrates, and I can't really recommend the current magazine except as a last resort.<br /><br />If you really care about becoming an informed citizen, and staying on top of current issues in science (and you should! your whole world depends on all sorts of scientific advancements!), you'll pick up Scientific American first. Scientific American can get heavy, but power through! You'll feel your brain getting tougher with every issue. You'll also see the real heart of science- healthy debate, and argumentation. Some issues have had to spend a healthy part of their text running counter-articles after a gathering of intellectual heavyweights wanted to clarify or argue something in a previous issue- that's real science in action. If you really want to fortify your mental reserves, you'll add on a copy of Skeptic to inoculate yourself against the hoodoo and brainwashing that often goes unquestioned in the media. Between these two, you will be continually challenged by new and fantastic thinking in every imaginable field. And there's no better way to help a kid along the path to scientific literacy, than to have a parent who understands the field first.<br /><br />Sure, the real science is in Science and Nature- some Nobel prize-winning advancements saw their first publications there- but Scientific American is the closest you can get without advanced training. And yes, if the only way you can possibly get someone (including yourself) interested in science is with pretty pictures, PopSci isn't a bad thing to have. Sometimes all of us need to feel like a kid, seeing a cool new toy and imagining what the world would be like if we had it, and that's what PopSci is best at.",[],B002CT515Q,B002CT515Q,AEHQILYLFLHZ2OONHOQCIHHYL2QA,2013-10-18 16:05:58.000,3,False

5,Years of Good Service and Good Info,"I have been getting this newsletter for years. Always get good service. Note that it is short, only about 12 pages, but really good info.

Almost every issue provides some sort of profound insight that I never considered before. For example: While I don't drink soy or almond milk, it never occurred to me that those items are low protein. I shared this with a number of friends and family that do drink it, along with an alternative pea milk to try.<br /><br />The authors definitely lean left, but are happy to bash left leaning media when it's deserved, which is often.

1,Useless...,"I initially purchased All You magazine in an attempt to save money.  For the first 3-4 months of my subscription, that worked fairly well because All You offered relatively high value coupons that you simply couldn't find elsewhere.  However, as time passed, the coupons became more and more worthless, and most of the values were exceeded by printable coupons available online, newspaper insert coupons, etc.<br /><br />By the time I cancelled my subscription, I'd received 3 issues in a row that hadn't contained one coupon I could actually use.  Again, I subscribed in order to try to save money, but I soon found myself paying for bad advice (much of which is collected from blogs), weight loss tips (despite the fact that I'm an active, fit person), and the sort of general nonsense (like awful fashion tips and bad recipes) found in all general interest women's magazines.<br /><br />Incidentally, All You magazine considers Walmart shoppers to be their target demographic (regardless of whether or not Walmart stocks the products advertised within All You magazine).

1,NOT the Rolling Stone I remember,"The current Rolling Stone magazine bears little resemblance to the Rolling Stone magazine of my youth.  Gone are the in depth articles of bands and band members, equipment and the latest gadgets.  Welcome in the age of politics, porn and tiresome reviews of artists who bear little resemblance to the term.  There are more advertisements for condoms, lubricants and sEx gadgets, with page after page of women in various states of (un)dress.  The articles on politics are always bent to the extreme left, with obviously no knowledge of the political system or the issues other than the writer's scant ""research"" has provided them.  The reviews of CD's are ridiculous in that they only cover a particular ""genre"" rather than across the board music.  I suppose that the only worthy musical genre anymore is hip hop?  Apparently so in the world of Rolling Stone. Sure, there is an article or two about the ""classic"" musicians, but those are few and far between.  I, for one, am sick of hearing about Lady GaGa, etc.<br />Moreover, the magazine has shrunk, and is now ""typical"" magazine size, which is annoying in itself.  I must note that I got this subscription at a trememdous bargain but I will NOT be renewing it.<br />If you are a music fan looking for an informative music magazine, please look elsewhere.

1,"Should be ""Cars -- Macs -- xBoxes -- Anything But PCs"".","I've been watching this magazine slide downhill for some time, but they've finally hit bottom.  The bulk of the April 25 2006 magazine was devoted to cars.  Yes, todays automobiles are becoming highly computerized, but the magazine is supposed to highlight the software and hardware that we use on our desktops.<br /><br />PC Mag has been drifting far afield, doing articles on Apple computers, gaming systems, and extensive reviews on cameras.  Instead of PCs, the subject seems to be anything that has a computer chip in it, or is in some way remotely related to computers.  The obvious inference is that there's nothing interesting going on in the PC world, so they have to keep stretching just to fill the pages.  I find that hard to believe; I think it's more likely that the staff has lost their focus, or they've hired people who are not interested in or qualified to write about PCs.  The lack of pertinent content makes the dwindling size of the magazine even more apparent.  What used to rival a small phone book is now about the size of Time magazine.<br /><br />They now have a ""new look"", and it's awful.  Their readership used to consist of well educated, technically sophisticated professionals.  These people don't need a dozen arrows pointing into every photograph, with cutesy ""handwritten"" notes belaboring the obvious.  That's more appropriate for the folks who had a hard time getting through high school and have short attention spans.  Compare this issue to the issues from a couple years ago, and it's obvious that they've ""dumbed down"" the entire magazine.<br /><br />I've subscribed to PC Magazine for years, and considered it a ""must read"" to keep up with the rapidly evolving hardware and software of the PC world.

The soda-lime/soft glass workers are well represented too: beads, sculpture, tips, tutorials - nothing that a beginner could manage, but education starts somewhere, as does inspiration.

I sent a notice back I only wanted the one gift. So then yesterday I got a FINAL bill for $44. Yes, $44! Their subscription services are infuriating.<br /><br />By this time, I was furious and just canceled everything by going to their web site.

3,Always informative and interesting.,"I have read carefully every issue of this magazine for more than 2 years. Every issue always features one article about a an advanced technique or a material that is coming into fashion such as raw diamonds or mixed media with leather and metal. It always has steps of 'how to' do the technique, and examples of innovative designs. It also frequently has articles about hand tools. Very often, I dislike the technique or the design, but the articles are still very informative. I always learn something new and interesting. People who have traditional taste or prefer an historical, intellectual approach to jewelry design and fabrication will not like this magazine.<br /><br />Subscribing to this magazine gives more than a colorful, information-rich magazine. It enrolls the subscriber into a rich marketing program that sends email about other Interweave (the publisher) crafts-related magazines and classes. Best of these is, the magazine subscription includes an annual catalog for the Tucson Gem and Mineral Show.

3,Wish There Was An Alternative,"First of all, I was a subscriber of Bass Player Magazine for about 6 years. That is about the time I started playing bass guitar in a rock cover band. Bass Player has changed over the years and I enjoy the newer articles on the rockers that I actually listen to in real life. I don't care so much for the jazz and upright bass scene, but the articles are interesting to read just the same. I find almost all the bass transcriptions way beyond my ability, but that probably only shows my lack of skill. I don't know how some reviewers state that the magazine is good for beginners, everything seems just beyond my reach, and I have been successfully playing bass in a cover band for years. I do think Bass Player is making more of an attempt at reaching players at my level, but they just don't seem to hit the mark, IMHO. I read the articles and get motivated by the stories. So the magazine is good in that respect.<br /><br />If I want to learn how to play something I can use in the band, I turn to YouTube.com for a video lesson or ultimate-guitar.com for the bass tab. Both of those resources are free, and have the resource material I need to learn to play a song. Bass Player typically only has one bass transcription per issue. If I could actually play some of those transcriptions, maybe I would feel more positive about it. But Bass Player typically picks songs with complicated bass lines that are beyond my ability. If you can play complicated extended 16th note bass lines, there is probably some good material there.<br /><br />Bass Player is an OK magazine, but I wish there was an alternative.

1,Beware of automatic renewal trap,"I'd give the magazine 5 stars for content, but they are canceled out by negative stars for their business practices. I subscribed for many years, normally renewing by check every two years. This year, instead of a request to renew, I was informed they had automatically renewed my subscription (which I never authorized), followed by multiple demands for payment. They basically portray you as a deadbeat for not paying for a renewal that you never ordered. I used to have a subscription to the website, which I paid by credit card, until I got tired of the annual double-digit price increases. Several years ago I canceled the website membership before it was up for renewal, but they charged by card anyway and took their time to eventually reverse the charge. I paid for the magazine subscription by check to avoid the automatic renewal trap, but apparently that no longer works. They have fine test cooks and editorial staff; too bad the people running the business have such low regard for their readers.",[],B000069YW9,B000069YW9,AETT4VW3J6BCJ77LJ7O7R6UZ423Q,2018-05-30 18:58:10.657,7,False

Or it might be possible they do not have a number of writers and photographers to keep you interested every month. Furthermore, the individual who was unable to see the rest if the article and the magazine might have been an issue on your end. How well did you treat the Amazon Customer Service when you called to complain? Why don't you splurge and buy an annual print subscription to read. You might find an advertisement for a medication that helps with irritability. The Mental Health community has come very far in new medications that won't cure what you have exactly, but they have come a long way.

1,Politically correct trash,"This magazine is nothing more that politically correct garbage. I am reviewing the June 2014 issue, which is now in my trash can. That's right, NOT the recycle bin as highlights suggests in the front of the magazine. It's in my trash can.<br /><br />First of all, I have nothing against seeing different races than my own in children's literature. But this magazine seems to accomplish it in such a way that it seems forced and not at all done in a way that just flows naturally. It became a game to me while reading it. &#34;And what will our next nationality be?? Turn the page to find out!&#34; Poem 1, white family. Story 1, Tex and Indi (no American white sounding Dick and Jane here-and I say this not because I WANT Dick and Jane but because it sounds like they went out of their way to pick names that DONT sound too American) multiple races portrayed. Story 2, Spanish, including a boy named Pablo, and many sentences in Spanish. Now, I have nothing against Spanish, but guess what? This is America! We speak English. I don't appreciate a magazine aiming language integration at my preschool age and younger children. Poem 2, white child. That's Silly page, every ethnicity you can possibly imagine represented. Story 3, African American family. Exercise action rhyme page, African American child. Activity page 2, Spanish father and son. The rest of the magazine is various animals. Now when you add this all up, you can see that High Five magazine has gone out of their way to make sure there is equal representation of all races, with extra consideration to making sure there are less whites than anything else. And that is where I get the &#34;forced&#34; feeling. It's like it's not okay to be white any more, we should be ashamed. I read many, many books and stories to my five children and I read about all nationalities and teach them about lots of cultures. But while doing that, I don't put down their own culture. This is what I felt when reading high five.<br /><br />Second problem: &#34;school&#34; obsession. Seeing as how this magazine is aimed at young children under five, there are an awful lot of references to &#34;school&#34;. Well at this age, it's not school, it's daycare. I happen to homeschool my children. I don't mind reading them stories about school, but this magazine goes overboard. The Tex and Indi story? School. Poem about fish? School (no pun intended). Picture of far and near? School bus right in center. The Summer Box story? School. That's a large portion of the magazine! American children have a lot more in their lives besides just school! What about sibling relationships? Travel? Holidays? Learning new things? Birthdays! Pets! Seasons! Learning about animals? I can think of a million things my kids would be excited to read a story about! This magazine is LAME when it comes to a variety of stories. It's like they sat around saying &#34;let's teach them about Spanish and school!&#34;..I'm surprised there isn't a full page spread on the new food groups.<br /><br />Lastly, my two youngest children didn't even enjoy the magazine. They couldn't relate to most of it! We don't speak Spanish, we don't go to school (they are 1 and 3!). They love to read, and I mean LOVE it. We read on average 5-10 books every single day. When they don't like something, that speaks volumes to me.<br /><br />Another warning. In small print inside the first page you will find the following: sometimes we make our list of customer names available to other carefully screened companies whose products might be of interest to you. TRANSLATION....we sell your personal information. Something to think about!<br /><br />I used to love highlights magazine as a child. This magazine is trash. I would never subscribe to it. I hope readers are able to see my review for what it is, just an honest review of what I saw, and not make this in to a debate about your beliefs versus mine. I'm not leaving this review for any reason other than to point out to parents what this magazine is like, in my opinion.",[],B000I0RKX2,B000I0RKX2,AFJ76HHRRYYJG5EHTQOAZTGCQOAQ,2014-09-24 20:06:47.000,21,False

5,Great for the Spanish classroom!,I am a Spanish teacher and keep this subscription so my students can read in the classroom when they finish work early.  I teach low levels (1-3) so they tend to ignore the articles but love to look at the fashion (especially once they have learned the clothing vocabulary) and advertisements.

I can't believe Amazon suggests buying this along with Time Out Chicago, who I've turned to for real information, colorful interviews, and articles that honestly do feel like Chicago does.  Yuck...all the focus on rich people makes me want to puke.  Why don't they count up some statistics on how many Chicagoans actually fit your sickeningly rich profile?  5 percent?

And, unless I am mistaken, Apple won the patent argument about two-finger zooming-out so I don't know that this method will continue to be an option on the Kindle.  While the magazine might look okay and be easily readable on an iPad, I don't have one and don't necessarily want one.  At the miniscule monthly price for the The Atlantic, it's probably worth the hassle of trying to read it on a Kindle...but holding the print version would be a heckuva lot easier.  You decide.  For me -- I think -- I'll forgo the print version because there are some articles that I just don't want laying around my house.",[],B000UHI2LW,B000UHI2LW,AEA4DMKTSCIG4QTFDP2K3A732GNQ,2012-08-30 14:57:42.000,2,False

It goes inside and behind the scenes in articles about the industry of entertainment.  True, it is neither earth-saving nor intellectually challenging, but then I believe that is why I enjoy it.  There are more than enough of those kinds of publications.  This one is for those of us who have a love of good movies and TV programming and like to have a place to read reviews<br />that will give us some direction in this regard.

2,GQ feels like it lost its identity and has been replaced by something??,"Back in the day, I used to subscribe to Best Life magazine. Back then, the advice was a little mature for me as it was catered to men in their early forties and I was only in my twenties. But now, I wanted to give GQ a try. Instead of being filled with advice on how to remain a gentleman, how to be an upstanding citizen in society, how to find the latest trends in clothes or how to keep a classic, etc. It's become a super nuanced sub-sub culture magazine seemingly written by 19-year-olds. Now before you criticize my review, I will state that there are some legitimate, well thought out articles but these are few and far between. A couple of articles I read are interviewing self-absorbed, dare I say cocky subjects - and the worst part is the interviewer goes along with it! I feel like it's catered to extremely young people and even though I constantly stay up to date and are usually hip to the latest trends and the latest technology, I sometimes find myself shaking my head and wondering what the hell I'm reading with GQ.

So, guess what I got this month?  That's right, Fangoria.  Maybe I'll only get 2 like the other guy.

I appreciate the do-ability of most projects presented in this magazine.

Its a magazine for serial remodelers like myself too who are old as God (well not quite) and living on a pension. Another good feature, in my book -  it generally is not about food.

1,Read the fine print,"Overall, I enjoy reading this magazine. It usually has fairly good, easy recipes and some good organization tips. I ordered this last year as a Black Friday special. It took several months for my first magazine to arrive.<br />When I ordered this subscription, I didn’t realize I was signed up for automatic renewal until I saw it in my order history this year. I was unable to cancel it (before shipment of the first issue) but I found it in my account and unclicked the auto renewal option (can’t remember where it was but definitely something I had to dig for.) Hopefully this worked and I’m not charged again next year. Some things on Amazon are impossible to cancel.

1,Very Disappointed,I'd like to start by saying the two years I have received Popular Mechanics magazine were for the most part very informative. However!.... Unlike on the Amazon site where its fairly obvious the great price for one year does include an “auto renewal” the Magazines effort at getting me to resubscribe looked great! It was just 8 dollars for one year AND I could send a years subscription a friend at no extra cost but when I just happened to look at the back side of the form to send them I noticed the small and very pale print that stated the “auto renewal” would be taking place. We all know this is information that should not be hidden but obvious to the would be subscriber. I decided I didn't want to do business with a company that conducted itself in that manner. Of course you just have my words as “proof” that I have made a true statement but never the less It needed to be said.,[],B001THPA26,B001THPA26,AFBFJ2LAT3DESPC6MWPPUBX5MXEQ,2014-02-25 06:50:45.000,9,True

2,Shameless overlap between advertising and editorial,"While there are a few good articles each month, the magazine routinely runs features touting advertisers who just happen to have paid for ad space in the same issue.

I don't trust their restaurant picks - again, the longer reviews tend to go to the restaurants who run ads.

2,"Reviewing Issues 1 to 30, What a Terrible Magazine.","I am only reviewing issues from 1 to 30 of Nintendo Power. Back then, I do remember them as I subscribed to the magazine every year for a few years. Then, I lost interest because the magazine was making a transition from NES to SNES. The biggest positive feature about the magazine is how colorful the artwork (at times, became too much while the actual screenshots of the games were too little) was. The worst feature of it was the paucity of information I was getting about the games that I actually played on. Let's not forget back then that NES games were too expensive to buy, even with the lowered salaries our parents actually earned. There were too many games mentioned in Nintendo Power that it was impossible for any average kid to own many of them. Needless to say, Nintendo Power became a huge shameless marketing tool to try to persuade the kid readers to succumb to their temptations and get their parents to give in to buy the games for them. Now, after 20 years, I've finally a look at the old issues and see what I currently think of them. First off, the writers did very well in explaining the basic moves for certain games. However, they didn't reveal very much about advanced moves. Sometimes, they didn't bother showing the readers other features of the game. It was just a load of irrelevant artwork. For example, in Super Mario Bros. 2, there was no illustration of using coins to pull the lever for slot machine at the end of each stage. Looking at the first issue, they did a very good job in explaining a lot of details and including a full scale of maps of each level so you can see what comes next throughout. But, why did they stop covering any more after a certain level and never look at the final two or three stages? A great example is Issue 1 where they covered Super Mario Bros. 2 from worlds 1-1 to 2-3 and just abruptly stopped thereafter. Same thing goes for Gauntlet where there were 100 rooms to explore, but only three were covered in Nintendo Power. In Issue 10 which was among the worst, there was so little information about Batman and Double Dragon 2 that the coverages became a joke. They didn't even try to explain what happens during a fight with Bosses. And there was nothing about the late stages of the games. Come on, that's all they got? Contra got absolutely weak coverage too despite its popularity. There is a lot of times that this happens, and it makes me to think that the writers actually never got that far or have not beaten these games. Moreover, the writers have exaggerated a lot about the features of the games (many of them were in fact terrible) which supports the notion that there was a clear bias involved. Looking at Nintendo advertisement where you use the Powerline to the Pros by calling them and then noticing in the table of contents where it says, ""Our pros can get you out of any video jam."" why establish the phone line already when it should be published in the magazine? Is that the magazine's goal to help you out on that because you paid for the subscription to it? Bah...they want to make more money off from the readers. On page 54 of Issue 1, what a weak advice about how to beat Mike Tyson. They can do better than that. Reading a lot of the advices elsewhere, Nintendo Power seems to be more interested in giving out cheat codes rather than instructing the readers in how to beat a game the pure way. Why was there information about movies, music, and celebrities who happen to play Nintendo? The magazine was supposed to be about the games of NINTENDO! What a waste of space. Then, there is a silly page of NES ACHIEVERS where players were recognized for their highest scores per game (um...Game Genie, yes? Of course, it came out in early 1990, making cheating very plausible; plus Nintendo Power never endorsed it due to supposed copyright infringement). Really, beating the game was, and still is today, always the ultimate goal, and nobody cared about points. Even a worse embarrassment was the recognition of achievements by ""Power Players.""  Time to get out of the house and smell the roses. What's with this Nester and the smug Howard Phillips? Get rid of them already! Why do they show crappy made up stories too? Can we stick with strategies of NES games? Every time I pick up an issue, it's always Zelda, Super Mario 2, Zelda, Metroid, Zelda, Super Mario 3, MegaMan, Super Mario 2, Super Mario 3, Zelda, Super Mario 3, etc. These games got the most coverage of any. Most unfair of them all, there was a 85 page issue (number 13) that was entirely devoted to Super Mario 3. Some of the other games received so little of coverage, and the rest had none (I was really surprised about the lack of coverage for The Simpsons: Bart vs. the Space Mutants) at all. You were out of luck if you were playing any of them because you were trying to figure out how to get past a certain point. Most likely, whichever the company paid the magazine the most got the most coverage. I still can't get over the sight of the dork in white jersey titled Nintendo Power every time I see him and his goofy hair. Damn, issue 5, pg. 19. features what may be the worst accessory of all time in NES history...the Power Glove (That commercial was very convincing. By the way, what happened to the review of the Super Glove Ball game in Nintendo Power?). Let us not forget the wonderful toy called U-Force. They really made it sound so good. The shameless promotion of crappy NES accessories was embarrassing; it would have been nicer if they could have admitted the truth that these accessories were in fact unworkable. However and interestingly, both of the accessories including some others were never mentioned again in future issues (sort of got swept under the rug quietly). Elsewhere, the PowerMeter was the most biased and worthless feature of the magazine because all of the games were thought of so highly and possessed no negative marks, but we all know after getting them, we recognized how truly crappy these games were. Some of the advices the ""counselors"" (what a ridiculous title) gave for certain games have been questionable at best, and there are certainly far easier solutions than them. One of the ""counselors"" claimed to have beaten Contra with one life left by using a Power Glove (either it is true or that guy needed a life). Looking at the work done for Mission: Impossible, I am 100% certain that nobody at Nintendo Power had ever beaten the game because they did a rubbish layout of the stages without going much into details. The whole coverage was entirely devoid of any strategy. For the game, I had already written a good review of it that included way, way more helpful tips in trying to beat it than they could do in those wasted pages. Looking at the letters of Mailbox, at least half of them had kids crying and begging to become a ""counselor"" while majority of them was bragging about their NES achievements. Hmm...so tell me...how many hours a day did these kids waste playing NES games (believe me, they take a very, very long time to master), and how much of that should have been put into homework from school? I love the endless pumping by the writers of the magazine, making sure people were directed to buy whatever the writers were pushing such as call line, cleaning products, technical repair, strategy guides, SNES, Game Boy, etc. Gosh, that Nester character was so annoying that he needed to be entirely cut out of the magazine. The comics were so boring, and they became page wasters. In the later issues, the layout of maps had improved considerably, and that alone will make Nintendo Power worth looking at. However, it was still limited to certain games. Rarely ever the writers will choose the most challenging NES games for greater coverage probably because their ""counselors"" probably couldn't advance further in the levels, let alone beating them. Hence, lots of cheat codes were provided in every issue. The biggest mistake of the magazine was the combination of NES and Game Boy, and then eventually SNES, coverages into one magazine. The result? Less and less exposure, then eventually extinction, for NES games which is a shame since we all know that the NES console is arguably the greatest console ever in Video Game history. Now I think of it: that was probably the biggest reason why I stopped bothering with Nintendo Power. The simple solution? They should have had separate magazines for each console. Thus, a lot of games could have been given more exposure, say 15 to 20 NES games per issue with 5 to 10 pages per. Also, get rid of the irrelevant art work and boring details about something else that are totally unrelated with NES games. Stick with the maps, strategies, and walkthroughs. Then, the writers would have been sitting on a goldmine. They never bothered with NES games made before Nintendo Power first came out which is another shame. All in all, Nintendo Power is truly a joke of a magazine, and we've discovered how thoroughly excellent gamefaqs and youtube of the games are today.",[],B0027ZK6P0,B0027ZK6P0,AFMC775V56QYCNU3ZWLDQOGCNAJQ,2011-02-02 01:21:56.000,0,False

3,"Great source for new information, but little ""how-to""","I have been reading PC Magazine for many years now, and out of all the PC or technology magazines I have subscribed to, this is the one I renew without a second thought. It keeps me up-to-date on everything computer related, while also keeping me up-to-date on new technologies and the convergence between PCs and other consumer electronics. The articles help me make informed decisions before purchasing or upgrading my technology.<br /><br />I find the best part of the magazine is actually the one-page editorials by Lance Ulanoff and John C. Dvorak (especially his ""Inside Track"", where he briefly touches on several topics on one page). Lance provides a one-page view on the current state of some computer or technology topic, while John C. Dvorak provides a humorous take on nearly anything. These actually make you think, and are more opinion/editorial than fact/reference.<br /><br />The magazine has become a fairly decent buying guide, pointing out the pros and cons of many different types of consumer gadgets, from computers, notebook PCs, mp3/media players, cellphones, printers, TVs -- anything. They also point out how these technologies work well together, and what they don't do so well. Some readers have complained how the magazine has moved away from its PC and computer roots over the years, but computing isn't what it used to be, especially for younger generations.<br /><br />Nearly every month, you'll find a how-to or reference explanation of some technology. For the most part, PC Magazine will explain how to set something up, but usually many of their steps lack detailed information and remain very, very basic. At times, especially when answering readers' questions, they'll simply write ""you can replace that"", but they never really provide the exact details. In this regard, PC Magazine is not for die-hard computer users, but is geared more toward the casual market. However, they often feature detailed articles on upcoming and cutting-edge technologies. Quite often, I'll find myself dog-earring the magazine's pages so that I'll research something in depth at a later time.<br /><br />My one major complaint: this magazine contains a lot of advertising, and probably 30-40% of its pages are full-page ads.<br /><br />I find that PC Magazine keeps me up-to-date and prevents me from making purchasing mistakes.

When that day comes, I will miss the feel and smell of print, the tactile experience of leisurely thumbing back and forth through paper copies, testing sample fragrances, and fighting those stupid cards that always fall out on the floor. :o)",[],B00005N7TM,B00005N7TM,AFXBZTQQFKBDOGT2NSQVEE5VHKCQ,2009-03-13 22:12:34.000,1,False

1,Changed for the worse,"For the third issue in a row, I didn't see any recipes that I wanted to try. I subscribe to several food magazines and usually find at least one recipe I want to try, so three in a row is unheard of.  I like to try new food and have really been branching out since I'm stuck in the house due to Covid. I get that they chose to go in a new direction, but the recipes look and sound unappetizing. There is no artistry in the pictures anymore. It is just food heaped on a plate or a bowl and it just doesn't look good. This issue was the last straw. Almost every page has some shade of orange in it for some reason and it wasn't flattering to a lot of the food . The layouts look like I did them myself, and I suck at creativity. I depend on the pictures in the magazine to give me ideas on how to plate this food that just took me an hour to make, and this doesn't cut it. I bought this from a discount subscription website and can't cancel, so it looks like I'm stuck with this for another two years.",[],B01H6WOM9Y,B01H6WOM9Y,AHXVGAFPISRXRFOITM4U3ILDGJAQ,2021-03-23 22:55:52.342,6,False
4,Subscriber for several years,"I had a hard time deciding between 3 and 4 stars. I look forward to receiving it each month. I consider this my dream catalog, because I can't afford most of the gear that is reviewed and don't have the time in one year to travel to all the places mentioned just in one issue. We try to make one really big trip every other year to places like Yellowstone, and this magazine comes in handy. Their tips can't be beat, and I really like their first aid and &#34;What to do if&#34; articles. Some of the pictures are nothing short of inspirational. On the other hand, it gets tiresome to read about the same 4 places every issue, especially Yosemite. I live in the Midwest, and I haven't seen anything more than one inch of article space per issue devoted to Midwestern trails in the 4 years that I have been subscribing. Believe it or not, there are places to hike here! I wish I knew more of them. I am a casual hiker, maybe more of just a walker of dirt trails. I pay less than $10 per year for this and wouldn't pay more without wondering if it was worth it. If you are a serious hiker and like to replace your gear a lot, this is the magazine for you. Otherwise, I would advise to just get a year subscription when the price is cheap and keep them for reference. They re-hash a lot of the same places every year.",[],B002BFZ9NA,B002BFZ9NA,AHXVGAFPISRXRFOITM4U3ILDGJAQ,2016-01-29 14:52:30.000,4,False
4,Long time subscriber,"I first bought this magazine  as a teen. I saw &#34;MONEY&#34; and thought, oh, I want some money! That particular issue extolled the virtue of the 401k and convinced me to enroll as soon as my job changed from part time to full time. The timing could not have been better. I grabbed the tail end of one of the biggest bull markets in history, and I managed to escape the dot-com bubble bursting with minimal damage. I learned about re-balancing in the nick of time. The magazine also described exactly how to borrow money out of my 403b for a down payment on a home. I would not have known about the tax saver credit, Coverdell accounts, or how to claim my college expenses on my taxes without this magazine. I can honestly say that I have a better standard of living because of it. I gave this review 4 stars because of it.<br /><br />Having said that, I didn't give 5 stars because this has slowly turned into the Reader's Digest of finance. It seems that they have mostly done away with the personal stories and financial fixes, and have added more and more articles about everything from what makes luggage worth the money to hiring a personal assistant. The articles are mildly interesting, but I loved the stories about how well (or bad) a real person was doing to compare myself to. Also, the longer you subscribe to Money, the faster you realize that they rehash a LOT of topics over and over. There is always the &#34;1,001 ways to prosper in (pick a year)&#34;, &#34;how to invest $1,000/$5,000/$10,000&#34;, and &#34;what to do with your money NOW&#34; issues. Sometimes I glance at the cover and think, &#34;My God! This again??&#34;. I find their Social Security issue (not sure if it comes out in a specific month) to be easy to understand and very helpful. They also report on any upcoming changes. I'm not anywhere near retirement age, so I pass those issues along to my parents after reading it.<br /><br />At one point, I subscribed to Money, Kiplinger's, and Smart Money (no longer in print) at the same time. They covered the same topics at the same time so if you have one subscription, you have them all. I just preferred Money to the others. Some people say that they can get more information online now, which is true. However, a lot of that information and well-meaning advice is wrong. I peruse several financial forums, and you would be shocked at how many people confidently post &#34;facts&#34; when they obviously have no idea what they are talking about. Act on any advice only after doing your own due diligence.<br /><br />I think this is a must-have for anyone starting out and I like to give a subscription to the high school and college graduates in my family. Now that I am solidly intermediate in my skills, I still like to skim the issues. Sometimes I find something helpful, sometimes I don't. Even if I get just one good piece of advice a year, it still pays for the cost of a subscription and then some. I never pay full price for a subscription, though. I wait for Black Friday and buy several years at once at a large discount.<br />.",[],B002PXVZ40,B002PXVZ40,AHXVGAFPISRXRFOITM4U3ILDGJAQ,2016-01-11 16:10:51.000,11,False

This magazine however seems to think that the only cars worth covering are BMW, Mercedes, Porsche, Audi and VW.  What about the French, Italian, Swedish or British cars?

5,"Not only for collecting, you can actually cook from it","Out of all of my subscriptions this one that gets used the most. The magazine is small but not hard on they eyes and it fits in my bag perfectly so I can take it with me, read it on the bus and by the time I hop off I can use it as my shopping list in any grocery store. I would usually scan or photocopy a recipe from a book or magazine or write out the ingredients but this cuts all those steps, I love it!<br /><br />The entire layout is very pleasing, from the font to the page colors, pictures and user friendly menus. The only hard part about it is which recipe to pick, because everything always looks good and the food is not pretentious, its food that is meant to be eaten and not constructed with a lot of sweating involved. From macaroni and cheese to rustic stews, fish dishes and new ways to make chicken I am always learning something new and interesting about food and preparation. I have recently enjoyed few dishes from the October 07 issue and amongst my favorites was a tasty Moroccan chicken stew with sweet potatoes with lemon , saffron and cinnamon, a Vegetarian black-bean chili, a sweet and crunchy Apple crisp and I wont forget to mention the Light chicken pot tie made with flaky phyllo crust. It's fun to make new things and add them to my repertoire for future meals, I always try to brighten my horizons when it comes to cooking new things.<br /><br />The magazine does a wonderful job of educating the reader about spices and herbs, each issue has tips and tricks and keeps an eye on nutrition. And let's face it, if you don't use your cookbook/magazine than what good is it?  Sure I like to look at pretty pictures and fantasize of making something one day but when it boils down to the daily grind and coming home tired, a hot tasty meal that is new and easy never disappoints.<br /><br />- Kasia S.",[],B0000ARXXS,B0000ARXXS,AGTIO2WD5NFWNXTFO57MJYCA5KWA,2007-09-24 11:07:18.000,5,False
5,"Fun, glossy and very useful!","After buying the first issue of Rachael Ray's new magazine I knew I would have to subscribe after only a few pages. Those pages were not only gorgeous and glossy, but chock full of fun facts, great shopping places for food and utensils, and of course tasty recipes that you do want to make. I have collected way too many cookbooks and food magazines that stand untouched because when it really boils down to it, its all about the food and some of those books and magazines did not deliver in the end.  I have since bought some great cookbooks and pay more attention to what's inside then what's on the cover.<br /><br />Rachael's recipes are not pretentious, and they certainly are interesting enough to engage the reader into trying them out. I've made several of the dishes from the Lemon cream pasta, Mushroom pizza, salmon and pasta dishes, to Sangria frozen pops and some great grilled food. Rachel provides shopping lists of standard pantry ingredients and fresh produce to buy, so its easy to see what you all ready have and what few things I can pick up on my way home to make a fun meal. I love making her recipes and adding them to my repertoire, as its nice knowing you can make a certain dish and its even nicer to whip up an easy dinner or lunch using this magazine.<br /><br />I also adore the fun articles you can find about restaurants, cheese diaries, wine tasting, outdoor grilling and foods for events. The magazine is really a beauty to read and has more information and entertainment than advertising. I cant stand the regular food magazine I used to get that were half full of Cat litter advertising, along with page after page of useless products screaming in my face.<br /><br />I hope this magazine will continue to bloom because I absolutely adore it and I intend on keeping every issue instead of tearing out recipes like I used to.

He wasn't impressed with the first two issues and complained of advertisements crowding the magazine.  He was excited to read a good article on beginning welding in his 3rd issue.  I took some time to leaf through the magazine before writing this review.  The advertisements are exhausting.  For example, in the first 10 pages of one issue, I counted 3 full page advertisements and 3 half page advertisements.  It's like that throughout the remainder of the magazine as well.  This is really unfortunate as it takes away from the readability of the magazine.  There is some useful information presented such as &quot;stuff we love&quot; which outlines favorite DIY tools, material, and gear.

If you're worried about auto-renewal issues, see my tried and true fix below.  This is my second year of HGTV magazine, and it has yet to disappoint.  It's jam packed with home redecorating ideas specific to the season.  My absolute favorite part of this magazine is the &quot;fun decorating&quot; page in issue that shows expensive items and their cheaper alternative.  (For example - a high end rug with a similar looking rug at over half the cost.) There's great advice on choosing paint colors for different rooms and how-to lessons on the correct way to refinish and paint furniture.  I love the &quot;spot the difference&quot; advice as well - learning the differences between various furniture and home goods so you're on your A-game in any conversation.  Also included is a great recipe in each edition.  I've clipped many of these and they've turned out to be easy and delicious!  Pretty much anything you can think of that has to do with your home is included in this magazine.  If nothing else, it makes for a colorful and festive bathroom book that anyone can flip through and enjoy.  My 12-year old daughter loves it for their crafts, cooking, and how-to advice.

It's a yummy recipe that readers get to &#34;name&#34; and prizes given out to the ones who win.  My favorite part, of course, is the abundance of recipes in every issue.  I've found a ton of new things to try...from soups to cocktails and everything in between.  Many of the recipes are basic enough that I have the ingredients at home.

Plus there are some great cooking articles and fun reads in side.  If you love the All Recipes website as much as I do but are tired of constantly printing recipes, give this magazine a try.  I will continue to renew this one no matter what the cost!<br /><br />I got this subscription for the ridiculously low price of $5 for a year's worth of issues.  There is no scam here...I've ordered $5 magazines from Amazon for the past 2 years and it's a simple process to avoid automatic renewing with an increased charge.  Simply go to your account and look under Membership and Subscriptions.  Find &quot;Print Magazines.&quot;  Once selected, you will see all of your current magazine subscriptions and when they will be renewed at the lowest Amazon price.  All you have to do is turn off the &quot;auto renewal&quot; setting by selecting auto-renewal settings and &quot;turn off.&quot;  It's as simple as that.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81QU6vMHrRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81QU6vMHrRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81QU6vMHrRL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81XLqg+9OFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81XLqg+9OFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81XLqg+9OFL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81lu8iVBkML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81lu8iVBkML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81lu8iVBkML.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01N702LLM,B01N702LLM,AE3MTQULT5KJCLJHVPJ4LPMMXXIQ,2017-10-18 20:16:49.863,675,True

4,"Good info, lacks polish","This is not your run of the mill fitness magazine like Shape, Fitness, etc. If you're looking to lose weight but are afraid to gain some muscle, this is not the magazine for you. Fitness Rx is perfect if you enjoy putting in your time at the gym doing both weights and cardio and like a dose of science with your articles.<br />Each issue has a ""Warm Up"" section featuring short blurbs from recent studies; some of the info will give you a ""well, duh..."" reaction and some you may not have heard before.<br />Each issue also has a featured workout and at least one more workout, as well as an interview with whoever designed the feature workout (usually an IFBB Pro competitor). These are great workouts that will deliver results.<br />Where is the lack of polish?  In the Warm Up section, sometimes the exact same blurb will appear on two consecutive pages, just with differently colored background and text. There are occasional misspellings. There are even article subtitles with misspellings in them. (In the middle of an article I can grudgingly accept, but title text? Really?) All minor nitpicks, but they add up if you find such things bothersome.<br />There is no shortage of advertising space in the pages, but IMHO the quality of information and workouts makes it worth ignoring the ads.<br />Overall I'm happy with my Fitness Rx subscription but wish it were edited a little better.",[],B0000CCY9P,B0000CCY9P,AELBWHF6I4WALUCAJ7KOKCICLRDA,2012-10-22 18:11:24.000,0,True

5,best home school resource around,"Back 15 years ago when I started homeschooling our oldest daughter, Mary Pride was my best mentor, thanks to her Practical Homeschooling magazine and the curriculum reviews in her Big Book series. Now with two home school graduates and five kids still plugging away at it, I still look to her for help as I face the new challenges that each unique child presents.<br /><br />  Practical Homeschooling represents without a doubt the very cutting-edge of the home school movement. No matter where you are in your home school journey, this magazine will help, whether you're a concerned relative who's wondering about socialization, or a scared newbie wondering where to begin, or a harried mom ready to give up, or a veteran hitting a new stage. Need help getting started?  It's there.  Finding a curriculum review?  She's got it. High school issues?  Yup.  College testing?  Uh, huh.  Managing teaching with a baby at the breast & a toddler on your hip?  She's been there, done that!<br /><br />  Something that's unique about this magazine, compared to others, is that it isn't afraid to use humor and or tackle controversial topics. Nor does it espouse a single educational philosophy. While you won't find lesson plans here, you will find a wide range of ideas and approaches. My experience is that, while I think I know the ""right way"" to teach, sometimes I encounter another viewpoint that entices me to look in a different direction.

1,DO NOT BUY!,"I was a subscriber to both this and Cook's Illustrated but after several very rude sales calls for their cookbooks and a barrage of mailings suggesting I renew, I really got turned off.  Two months before my subscription ended I notified the magazine in writing and by phone that I did not intend to renew, and the magazine still keeps coming. Now I'm getting late notices for not paying my bill.  Shameful tactics.<br />I'm so turned off by the entire company now.  I don't watch the show any more and am trying to unsubscribe to Cook's illustrated.<br />Like others here after ordering the cookbook I too was sent another one the following year with a large bill.  I promptly sent it back then received phone calls (not &#34;a sales call&#34;) asking to buy the book.  When I repeated told the girl on the phone that I already had the book, she hung up on me.<br />You may have noticed that to get a recipe on their website you have to enter your email address and many times a credit card.

2,"I want to love this magazine, but I just don't","I adore Fixer Upper and I love Joanna's book, Home Body, so I purchased a subscription to Magnolia Journal thinking it would be a slam dunk. It's not. There's a lot to like about it - gardening tips, recipes, design ideas, travel recommendations - but I can't help but feel like I bought a self-help book. This latest edition (summer 2019) has 4 separate articles on ""freedom"" - like ""feel free to say no"" kind of stuff. No, really!? No offense, but why would I look to Joanna Gaines for advice on how to live my life? And why would I want to read about that in a magazine? Also, I thought I liked Joanna's design style a lot, but after getting several editions of this magazine, perhaps I don't. Unlike the show, I find that the magazine leans towards modern design rather than showing an eclectic mix of styles. Finally, my last beef is that Joanna is on every cover...and she and Chip seem to write a lot of the articles. Maybe it's just me, but it seems a bit self-centered and it's too focused on the Gaines family rather than what they excel at. For those reasons, I will not be renewing this magazine subscription.",[],B01N35UMQV,B01N35UMQV,AGJ7RZNON7WBGS7HTEVI5QA63V4A,2019-05-01 20:59:00.198,18,True

3,Great magazines-very poor customer service from this company,"I have 5 grandchildren who have all been getting magazines from Cricket since they were in the  &#34;Ladybug&#34; stage.

First of all, they are terribly unorganized. Have been trying for 3 years to get all 5 of these magazines filed under one account number, and for some reason that seems to be impossible with this company.

1,Ordering magazines did not work out.  It was auto renewed even though I tried to make certain it would not when I placed the ord,I am angry because purposely did not sign up for auto-renewal and if I did it was because it was not clear enough for me to understand.  What I was afraid of has happened.  It went from 7.00 to 19.99.  I have cancelled the auto renewal and asked them to stop the subscription and refund the rest of the money.  Will add another message regarding the results.  It said they will cancel subscription.  This is no reflection on the magazine because I like the magazine.  ADDING:  I am still disappointed about the increase and auto renewal but have received a notification that one of my two orders to cancel the Dr. Oz magazine has been completed.  The other is still pending and I don't know why but they have responded fairly quickly.  But I will not receive the full refund because they have already issued at least one magazine on my gift subscription and probably will be two on my own.  Fortunately I like the magazine and so do my friends.  I have been ordering from Amazon for years and this has been my first problem so wouldn't quit buying from them except magazines with auto renewal.,[],B00PE3SN7U,B00PE3SN7U,AHFYYUO3VCKNVR5WLGB4ONNTXZ2A,2015-05-10 19:04:05.000,2,True

There are articles in this magazine dealing with taking care of aging parents, grown-up kids who won't leave the nest, making your way in the corporate world, and lots of other things that are relevant to women my age and their lifestyles.

Don't be put off by the review posted that said there was no way to reach anyone about a missing subscription.  First, given that it is only published every other month, and the delay in getting things back and forth over the Atlantic, it isn't too surprising that there could be a few month delay in beginning a new subscription.  But there IS a phone number (...) and email address (...) for their US distributor, The British Connection, which also handles their sister publication, The English Home.  I started with the gardening magazine and added the home one about a year later, and I love it just as much.

4,Best on the market,"I have been a fan of National Observer crossword puzzles for years.  The puzzles range from fairly easy to challenging.  However, over the past couple years I have noticed a lot of errors in the publication and think that if there is one place there should be zero errors, it is in a crossword puzzle book. This drives me crazy. I have been tempted to call and apply for the job of proofreader!  Another complaint I have is that too many of the puzzles are becoming ""cutesy"".  They are not straight crossword puzzles but puzzles that, say, require you to leave out certain letters, or insert Roman numerals for letters,or have some other sort of twist.  I realize that some people may enjoy this, but I just want the straight crosswords. Also, and this probably isn't the case in fact, but sometimes I get the feeling the puzzles must be fairly old, because many of the answers probably would completely elude anyone under the age of forty, which, unfortunately, I am not.

5,if you follow the instructions the digital works great,"I've access the magazine within 5 minutes of purchase on both my Kindle Fire and Android Phone.<br /><br />The key is to use the &#34;Sign In&#34; at the top of the app, not the sign in for print subscribers.

5,Great buy from Amazon,"I purchased this magazine just before Christmas for $5 for a 2 year subscription.  Honestly, I had never even seen a copy of Marie Claire before it showed up on my door, and I didn't have high expectations (especially considering the price).<br /><br />I have to say that I'm very happy with the magazine overall.  The demographic is probably best described as women from 20-35 who are career driven and don't have children.  I say this because there really isn't much ""family stuff"", moreso things on dating and articleds for single working women.  It also isn't really for a young ""teenage"" demographic.<br /><br />There is also surprisingly a lot of substance to this magazine for the price.  There are a lot of longer articles and most of them are fairly well written and intersting - worth reading at the very least.<br /><br />My only gripe about the magazine is that the fashion is a bit pricy.  Most of the shirts/pants/dresses they show as being in style are listed as costing around $800.  Not exactly sure who can afford that.  On the other hand, it's not like I ever buy the clothes I see in magazines anyway.<br /><br />Another thing that people said is that they never received any of the magazines.  Well, I placed the order at the end of November and my first issue arrived early January so as long as you put the information in correctly it should promptly arrive at your door.<br /><br />This magazine gets 5 stars from me based on price and the fact that I was impressed by the magazines overall content.",[],B000LXS9Q8,B000LXS9Q8,AGTCNUHG55GMIWS2YYOJ6JJY7EZQ,2010-01-18 03:34:12.000,0,False

2,Mostly ads,"I got hooked into ordering this magazine because there are some great DIY articles on their website, and I thought it might be nice and inspiring to see some projects and read about emerging technology in the print magazine. Boy was I disappointed. I have only received two issues so far, but from what I have seen it is mostly advertisement. Even some of the key articles are cleverly disguised advertisements. For example, the most recent issue had an article about how to build your own backyard fire pit. I turned to that article only to find that it was less an ""article"" and more like installation instructions for a $500 kit that is basically made of retaining wall stones. There are several supposed ""articles"" like this that are really nothing more than cleverly disguised advertisements.<br /><br />Also, I don't care for the way they lay out their articles. They are very choppy with bits and pieces of writing laid out on top of pictures, rather than structured paragraphs. Like I said, I have only received two magazines so far. If it manages to impress me through the rest of my subscription I will come back and improve the star rating, but for now it seems like they missed an opportunity to deliver legitimate articles to the casual techie and DIY guy.<br /><br />All of that being said, if you can see through the advertisements there is still a bit of entertainment to be gleaned from the articles and it is worthy of sitting next to the porcelain throne for casual looking through, much like a catalog or used car trader magazine might.

5,Great Magazine!! Not so great disc,"I'll start off by saying that I am an OXM subscriber for 2-3 years now. I got hooked after getting a free two-issue trial (who knew those worked for companies?!), and I've loved the magazine ever since.<br /><br />It really is a great magazine. The OXM crew is great. They make a very appealing magazine with interesting material. The reviews are superb, as are the previews and other articles. It's a more formal magazine than the late EGM, but it's informal enough that there is some slang thrown in there and many pop-culture references.<br />Plus, if you only own an Xbox and don't really care about other system offerings, then there is no reason to get a magazine like GameInformer which will have your Xbox information bogged down by Wii and PS3 stuff. Get OXM.<br /><br />My only negative to OXM is the disc that is included with it. I have received the disc my entire subscription, but as of lately, I have not even used them at all. At first, when I didn't have Xbox Live, they were great. I could try out all demos and see some high-def trailers on my tv, but now that I have Live, there is nothing worth anything on the discs, except for month old demos. If I want to try a new demo, I can download it from Xbox Live or wait a month for OXM to possibly include it on their next disc. It's not worth it.

The code ""USA3"" still works; 13 issues delivered to USA for 50 Pounds.  Great magazine, highly recommended.<br /><br />8/6/2012 Time to renew?  Promotional Code ""USA3"" no longer works.  ""USA4"" is a new code, does work, but the price is £65 for 13 issues.  That's over $101 USD and exceeds my budget by a lot.

1,"Too Many Ads, Not Enough Content","When you get a copy of the American Vogue, the first 5 pages at least are full page ads for fashion, fragrance, or whatever else. The table of contents is typically 1-2 pages. Once you start flipping through the magazine, you find the average length of an article is 1/2 to 1 page long. It's difficult to discern the fashion photo shoots that are part of the actual magazine content from the articles themselves. The fashion tips and photo shoots are not based on any real style insight but rather on who has bought sponsorship in the magazine. If you really want to read this magazine, I suggest you flip through it at the library or while waiting for an appointment at some office that has a subscription. It will take you less than 30 minutes to read the entire magazine from cover to cover and the only thing you'll be left with is knowing that is 30 minutes of your life you are never going to get back.",[],B00005N7TG,B00005N7TG,AG5XIVAWZKWY3VJJVYDTYVOGTZ4A,2012-01-08 19:57:42.000,2,False

2,Not sure what sort of audience is intended,"I tried out a couple issues of this magazine through Maghound's service.  I really don't care for it!  Let me say that I do not have a scientific background at all, beyond general required classes in college, a good deal of documentaries and so forth.<br /><br />Most of this magazine's topics read like quick ""sound bites"" and include a big picture and a short caption, in the space of 1/2 a page.  Usually the short caption just makes you want more information.  And what is deemed to warrant full article status are the more general topics that you might expect to find in a high school textbook. The issue in front of me now has an article explaining how the sun works to influence Earth's climate; an explanation of what causes Auroras or Northern Lights; an article about the history of developing space planes and rockets.  And mangrove forests.<br /><br />I will type for you the first paragraph of the very general article about mangrove forests (four paragraphs across an 8-page spread).<br /><br />""For many, the word 'forest' conjures up images of mountaintop pines and woodland creatures.  But on tropical and subtropical coasts around the world, there are forests of a very different sort: mangroves.  A diverse group of trees and large shrubs that sprout in salty tidal waters, mangroves and the forests they create are home not to chipmunks and bears but to fish and tigers.""<br /><br />The above first paragraph is characteristic of all the ""cover stories"".  the article doesn't list the author, just the photographer.  So, is this a magazine for kids or what exactly?  Who thinks bears and chipmunks live in tropical forests?  And why would those same people be subscribing to a science magazine?<br /><br />Yet, the mag teases you with interesting photos throughout, with miniscule captions or paragraphs that are cramming so much into a small space, it's hard to understand.  A lot of it seems to assume more science knowledge than I have, in stark contrast to the actual articles.  My brain just says, ""What? Why?"" and I long for explanation and more depth.  You could still learn from it by heading to the internet and researching more about the real story behind these tid-bits, but that's not why I read magazines.  I read magazines on paper because I want them to inform me and interest me, not try to imitate TV or the internet with tiny bits of information flying at me but no meat.

My 7 year old tries to squirrel it away so that his younger brother can't read it.  He'll read it for hours--and loves to entertain us with facts he learns.  My younger son (5) is a beginning reader, so he can't read it very well on his own, but loves the pictures and activities.<br /><br />Both boys also love ""Wild Kratts"" on PBS--and I think this is a good tie-in.<br /><br />I'm very happy with the magazine; however, if you've never seen it, check out an issue at your library or bookstore.",[],B000063XJL,B000063XJL,AHZ7T7AGIWXAVBYUCOFRX2OJBNPQ,2011-04-01 12:38:12.000,15,False
5,"One of the Few Where I Always Try a Few Recipes, Super Family Friendly","I'm one of those people who seem to subscribe to a lot of cooking magazines and buy a lot of cookbooks, but never get around to trying many of the recipes.  ""Cook's Country"" is one of the exceptions.  Without fail, I always find at least four or five recipes in each issue that not only do I want to try... I actually do.  I think it's because, for the most part, these are the recipes I and my family want to eat.  And you know what? Without fail, every single recipe I've ever tried has turned out.  Another nice feature is the picture index so you can see what you're going to make.  If your family likes American classics (including some takes on our favorite ethnic take outs), you'll like Cook's Country.  If you don't want to subscribe yet, I recommend picking it up at Costco or one of the other warehouse clubs--as the savings makes a big difference.

5,Excellent Quality for the Money,"Dell also is the owner of Penny Press, and these puzzles follow very similar formats to the bigger penny press booklets here on Amazon (eg: [[ASIN:B00EYGCVTO Puzzler's Giant Book of Sudoku-Vol. 24]]). Although Challenger is supposed to be black belt/very hard, some of the hards are more difficult than the challengers. None of even the hardest are the two day guess and retreat nightmares; at worst the hardest might be spread format with only one 9 and one 7. If you're moderately good you can get even the worst done in about two hours. Most of the challengers can be done in about an hour and most of the hard between 40 minutes and an hour.<br /><br />If you can do doubles and triples and row an column elimination, the easy and medium will be a breeze. Most of those have a low hanging fruit elimination of at least 3 to 4 numbers first pass. You don't have to do outside box trials until the hards (little internal pencil pairs are enough for the mediums and easy almost all resolve with just row/column crosses).<br /><br />These are generally the second best designed puzzles (Nikoli are the best, and are all human crafted; Example at:[[ASIN:0761158359 Expert Sudoku]]), have humans and not just computers designing, or at least looking over the computer designs, and are of course guaranteed to all have unique solutions. There are two different magazines with this subscription (4 of each in 12 months), and each has a little over 180 puzzles-- about page 100 of the penny press books (which have over 500 puzzles).<br /><br />Note that this is a MAGAZINE subscription, not a book order, so it will take at least a month depending on the publication cycle for your first one to arrive. The amazon default also is auto renew, so if you don't want that, go to subscription management in your account and change. You WILL get a ""warning"" from Amazon a month ahead before it auto renews so you won't be surprised, which is time to change to manual renewal or to cancel.

5,More Than a Mag - It's Money In the Bank,"If you are looking for ways to cut day-to-day living costs for your family, this is a magazine you should buy.  I am not normally a person who cares for ""home"" or ""ladies"" magazines - but a subscription to ALL YOU will literally end up being FREE because each month it's loaded with high-end coupons for things like cosmetics, food, drinks, household products, etc.  Even if you only ended up using one or two coupons a month you found in this mag, it would defray the cost of the subscription.  Plus, there are excellent articles on where to get the best deals.  They run articles you would typically find in most women's magazines - fashion, receipes and you aren't going to find alot of gossip about the Hollywood bunch.  It's a practical magazine, geared toward helping you get more for less, geared toward helping you find the best places to shop for what you really need, geared toward helping families, especially with children, lessen the expense of maintaining a household in all kinds of creative ways.  Originally, I only purchased the magazine to get all the coupons, but I've been impressed with some of the articles they've presented.  It's definitely been a good investment.  And the best part is, they have a little index in the first pages of the magazine which lists which coupons are included in the month's issue - by alphabetical order - that tells you how much the coupon is worth and what page you can find it on.  That makes it very easy when you see, for example, a cosmetic item on sale at your drugstore because you can quickly flip open the magazine and look to see if they have a coupon you can stack with the sale price to get the best deal.<br />I highly recommend this subscription to anyone wishing to save money on a regular basis, especially if you are on a tight budget.  Again, if you utilize the coupons, this subscription truly ends up costing you nothing and saving well more than it cost.",[],B000W3MB5W,B000W3MB5W,AFCSGAYPRVJJOW4472RHGMEWOIIA,2011-03-19 10:52:27.000,6,True

2,The Mighty have Fallen,"SciAm was once the prime science magazine for Americans. I read every issue for decades. The writing style was high level and having a good background in science certainly helped the reader. They'd include a mix of hard and soft science in every issue.<br /><br />The columns were wonderful, Martin Gardner would educate you in math and the Amateur Scientist would teach you how to build your own seismograph or telescope.<br /><br />But very sadly indeed, the editors have become converts to Al Gore's religion of warmism. The hard science section of the magazine is infested with pseudoscience fantasy articles by die-hard warmists. The columns once a joy to read, are now even worse. As is the current events section. Martin Gardner must be up to 100 rpm in his grave as are the lamented lost columnists of the Amateur Scientist.<br /><br />So I have let my subscription lapse. I'll check the issues as the hit the news stand at the grocery and see if there are a few good articles and whether it is worth buying this month's. Right now I guess I get 4 or 5 issue a year.<br /><br />And I hope that someone will stage a coupe in the editorial offices and throw the bums out. And return SciAm to its days of glory.

4,My preferred Women's Magazine,"After having subscribed at various times to everything from Martha Stewart's &#34;Real Simple&#34; to &#34;Family Circle,&#34; I find that Good Housekeeping remains my favorite.  Here are the features that make it shine above its competitors<br />1) Real, scientific product reviews of practical items from knives to pillows to wrinkle treatments<br />2) Featured clothing styles, while still averaging above my Target and Ross budget, tend to be significantly more approachable than most magazines which seem to consider it normal to pay three figures for a pair of pants.<br />3) Recipes tend towards the practical and relatively achievable even on a weeknight.  There are some semi-exotic options, but in general they don't call for terribly expensive ingredients. I appreciate their &#34;Triple Test&#34; methodology on said recipes, where several different cooks from their test kitchen make the dish, varying equipment and ingredient brands.<br />While I have little use for celebrity interviews, everyone's got them and I won't make an issue of them.

I am a digi-scrapper so I'm not quite so inspired by the product reviews: the value for me is in the page sketches.  Most issues include a pull-out page containing 30 or more of them that were featured in the current magazine.  I especially appreciate that most featured layouts include 4 to 6 or even more (12!) photos on a two page spread: very few of those impractical 1 and 2 image pages that normal scrappers cannot afford the time or money to make!

4,Not perfect but who is?,"Let me first say that I love Prevention.  It's chock full of helpful factoids, tips, health info, etc.  I do learn something useful form every issue I read.  I also occasionally question its accuracy.  For instance, are EMFs as dangerous as the January issue claims and, if so, are they dangerous to the degree and in the ways the author claims??? It's not a highly specific criticism about anything in the article...it just struck me as a topic that may be too new to make substantive statements about their long-term health effects.  Still, I will be pulling out my headset when I need to use my cell phone for calls.  I don't want to go back for paying for a land line phone but I'll compromise with my Skype service rather than relying on my cell for home service.

1,Was wonderful... once.,"I subscribed to this magazine first in high school, and I adored it.  I mean, adored.  I looked forward to nothing like its arrival.  I even won one of their monthly contests, once.<br /><br />That was then, this is now.  They dropped it to bimonthly with no fanfare that I ever saw, and the price is still identical.  But the big thing is that Writer's Digest is now one big shill for the ""self-publishing"" industry, with the better part of the ads for shady operations happy to take several thousand dollars of your money to put your name on the cover.  And the magazine itself has shifted accordingly.  Articles continually laud self-publishing as a wonderful option and talk about it like it's a writer's dream... never mind that many of the publishers they take money from have never had a commercially successful author and never will.<br /><br />The joys of the past are gone.  The monthly contests now have no prizes, that I've been able to see.  The neat little articles on intellectual property accompanied by ads admonishing us that Xerox and Rollerblade are proper nouns are gone.  The interviews are now insipid and most of the articles read like they were hacked together in an afternoon with information that could be easily found online.<br /><br />Skip Writer's Digest.

2,Too Well-Rounded?,"Just canceled my subscription, after a year-and-a-half. Unfortunately, for my tastes and lifestyle (40s, married, business owner, no children). I think Redbook is trying to be too well-rounded. I used to love this magazine (especially back in HS and college), but now it seems like it trying to appeal to too many audiences at once...a few pages of Cosmo-style sex-related articles, a few pages of Women's World-style life-threatening articles, a few pages of Health- magazine ""you too can have abs of steel"" articles, and way too pages of Parent's Magazine-style articles. The only thing I found myself enjoying was the ""Most Embarrassing Moments"" feature. I think that a magazine with an article about ""Red Hot Sex Kissing Games"" a few pages away from an article about ""Kids Get Dry Skin Too"" is not focused enough. On top of this (and perhaps because of it), it seemed as though most of their articles only touched the surface of any one topic, -- all headlines and captions, no substance. I think Vanity Fair, Jane, or Marie Claire might be a better choice for those who want a more focused magazine that delves into its topics more thoroughly.",[],B00005N7SG,B00005N7SG,AGUYERSOS2F3XMBLF2LIQR42CLOQ,2002-02-06 16:40:08.000,113,False

These are two important topics but, IMHO, not for 8 year old readers.  I also wished the discussions of ""huge crushes"" on boys had been left out.  If I had reviewed these two issues before subscribing, I would not have done so at this time.<br /><br />In addition to these ""older"" topics, there is some other good content.

2,"Ads, ads, ads!","I purchased this 1-year subscription when it was a lightning deal and boy am I glad more money was not spent. Every other page seems to be a full page advertisement. In the most recent issue I received, you actually have to go all the way to page 42 before you do not run into a full page ad.<br /><br />The pages that do have actual magazine articles are odd font sizes and very difficult to read by writing style. The stories seem to be recycled every month, and usually have little to do with health. They seem to focus on the word ""Women's"" more than they do ""Health"". A 3-page Botox ad just doesn't seem very fitting to me in terms of health.<br /><br />Despite how much I tried to like them, after two months of going through the entire magazine ""because I paid for it"", it now heads pretty much straight to the trash.<br /><br />Not recommended even at a deal price.",[],B000A177ZA,B000A177ZA,AHC6SBY4BWWM53YDITOPOC5HSHGQ,2012-07-08 23:30:49.000,12,True
3,A little too controversial for my taste.,"The positive:<br /><br />When I first started reading this magazine 14+ years ago it was primarily centred around hard science with a sci-fi take on technology and what our lives in the future might look like. If you're someone who finds the details of science to sometimes be a little boring and convoluted then this magazine is a great way to bridge the gap between those details and the remarkably stellar outcome. It doesn't matter if you're an 8-year-old girl or 75 year old man; every issue has at least one or two articles you will find interesting and worth reading.<br /><br />The negative:<br /><br />Although I still find articles I enjoy I have witnessed the magazine change as it takes on a more political role the last 5-7 years. As a result I often see articles which try to reinforce political issues on global warming, green energy and even GMOs.  If you're more &#34;liberal&#34; in the modern day meaning, then you will feel right at home. Unfortunately for me I'm more liberal in the classical sense. The ads in the magazine are yet another downfall to this publication. I understand they have to make money and this is one way of doing it, but having an article about the negative effects of second-hand smoke running concurrently to a cigarette ad seems editorially lazy.<br /><br />Final thought:<br /><br />It's worth a years subscription to try out. If you're bothered by ads about male enhancement, alcohol/cigarettes and sex pillows/swings, then you might want to consider National Geographic instead. If you're ok with the ads, however you don't like the politics Pop Sci favors, then check out their brother magazine Popular Mechanics.",[],B002CT515Q,B002CT515Q,AHN5SBJWZBAJLH5BLWCEOBPOJ6VQ,2015-01-06 19:13:54.000,3,False

Nebraska Life magazine does a great job with photography, profiles, history, and interesting features across our state that simply don't get covered on the television or newspaper.<br /><br />What else but a Nebraska-focused magazine can devote pages to photographs of clouds looming over the Nebraska vista, prairie chicken leks, the revival of the small-town railroad, WPA-era post office murals, or the Hastings Ordinance Depot?<br /><br />On a whim, we tried Nebraska Life out as a LivingSocial deal.

1,Subscriber since 1st issue. 4 to 1 star Update: Shonen Jump Alpha!,"Update: Shonen Jump is ending next year, and unless you want to subscribe to the online release of Shonen Jump Alpha, don't subscribe to this.<br /><br />Update: Just realized my June issue is a June/July issue....great. I guess my beloved magazine is slowly dying. :(<br /><br />I remember seeing the first issue of Shonen Jump on newstands in 2003 and thinking it was the coolest thing ever. I was around 12 or 13 then, and I still love it as a 21-year old. It has always been a great value considering that the average volume of manga is around ten dollars or more.Also, I used to be a yugioh fan, and Shonen Jump provided me with a countless amount of awesome free promo cards.<br /><br /> Having read every issue, I've seen Shonen Jump go through every phase. While I understand that the economy may cause Viz to have to make certain changes, they are still negative changes and I'll list them here:<br /><br />First off, Shonen Jump had the magazine, and then they began publishing the manga that ran in their magazine in their Shonen Jump Graphic Novel line. Well, that is fine. The problem is, they began to remove series from their magazine in mid-story. It would say, Hikaru No Go is ""graduating"" to thier Shonen Jump Graphic Novel line, and lucky you, you can now read it faster! Hooray!!! I got to read it for free, now I have to go to the effort of hunting it down, then paying around a hundred dollars or so for the rest of the series.I get that certain series are more popular than other series, but it has happened many times, and the only series that have finished are Sandland(very short series) and Yu Yu Hakusho.Recently they were really pushing a manga called Ultimo, which is co-made  by Stan Lee. They treated it as their flagship exclusive manga, but once again removed.<br />That move definitely suprised even me after all the hype. Dragonball Z, Shaman King, Hikaru No Go,Gin Tama,Yugioh GX, Tegami Bachi, and Ultimo, are all victims of ""graduation"" I can think of off the top of my head.They also do speed-ups where they skip chunks of story to catch up with manga in Japan. Makes sense, so not that big of a deal there.Secondly,the magazine seems to have gotten a little thinner in the past year. Those are my only gripes with the actual magazine itself.<br /><br />My main gripe with Shonen Jump is that recently they are clearly now trying to give a priority to newstand buyers over subscribers which is an unforgivable, greedy, and disgusting act. Shonen Jump has always advertised the subscription as ""get it before newstands"". As a subscriber, I always have. VERY early. That is until the most recent year. Now, while I'm waiting, I go to Wal-mart, FYE,and Waldenbooks, and have to stare at a brand new issue, that I as a subscriber have to wait for.<br /><br />The customer service used to be good, but has definitely suffered. If I ever miss an issue, I never have a problem. What I dislike now is that the c.s. operator now tries to give the runaround by giving you corporate answers, and doesn't want to listen to your problem.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I still love Shonen Jump. I just hate to see something I love degrade in quality little by little. Please don't forget your core subscribers Shonen Jump.",[],B001BKE2MU,B001BKE2MU,AE7XBSGTG4CANJJ545NTDZNOQQ2A,2011-03-30 18:40:09.000,21,False

Once the issues started rolling in, I quickly realized that even for the price of free, this mag is hardly worth the paper it's printed on. The issues are like 1/4 the size that they used to be back in the magazine's glory days. And with the advent of the internet, it is a wonder how printed magazines like this stay afloat.

Only 1/4 of the mag is made up of actual articles and even those are ""bleh"".  For example, my buddy just picked up the mag and said, ""is there something you wanna tell me?"".  Why did he say that?  Because there were 4 articles on being gay or the wonderful rich feeling that comes with being gay.  Uhhhhh, ok.  I just wanted to know how to dress nice.  For example, Tom Ford writes that if your straight you must sleep with a member of the opposite sex at least once in your life and then proceeds to call you a dunderhead if you don't. Ok, fine, I get that, it's an opinion by a fashion designer. But then a couple pages later there's a huge article written by the mag itself about ""the rise of the alpha-gay"".

5,A Quick Review of a Key Writing Tool,"I call Writer's Digest a writing tool because for years many writers have relied upon the information given within the pages of this thin monthly magazine. As soon as I began writing I started buying this magazine and reading it with a highlighter close at hand. It provides information for all corners of the writing industry, whether it's from starting a story to selling an article to doing the taxes at the end of the year; everything here is geared toward making a writer's life just a bit easier (and for those of you who are attempting this as career, you know just how important something like this could be). To add to that, there are a lot of inspirational articles and sections that can give a young writer the push needed to get writing.

When I looked at it on Amazon, I noticed that there were some reviews with one star and comments about the magazine sending a special issue and arbitrarily counting it as two issues against peoples subscriptions.  I think this practice is terrible and understand that it is becoming more prevalent in the industry. Remember when a half gallon of ice cream was 2 quarts not 1.5 or a half gallon of orange juice was 64 oz. not 59 oz.  I understand the concept of inflation and the need to raise prices but ethical businesses do it up front publicly, not by sneakily under-weighing or short-changing and covering their butts in the fine print. I go out of my way to find ice cream that still comes in 2 quart containers and orange juice in 64 oz. bottles.  We constantly read stories in the news about greedy businesses ripping off people just because they think that they can get away with it. I can certainly understand why subscribers would be upset.  I will not subscribe to a magazine that does this and the next time I go for a haircut I will encourage my barber to complain to the magazine and to tell all his customers about this practice.",[],B002PXVYEQ,B002PXVYEQ,AFGWJTCVM7XCZQQDSRWPXXHMAXPQ,2011-12-16 15:09:24.000,8,False

3,"Losing its ""Southwest Art"" focus","I'm a long-time subscriber to the magazine, but have joined many other readers in noticing its drift away from the genre of its own title. While ""Art of the West"" and ""Western Art Collector"" both maintain a strong focus on true western art, ""Southwest Art"" is becoming more generalized in its content, overlapping ""Art in America"" significantly. There are always a few pages of true southwestern art, but the vast majority of the magazine features cityscapes, floral still lifes, ballerinas and dancers, seascapes and boats, roads, etc. In fact, most of the glimpses of actual southwestern art (mountains, Indians, cowboys, buffalo/elk-style wildlife) are found not in the magazine's content, but in the advertisement images.

1,Magazine Isn't Bad But Doesn't Know Its Audience,"I love motorcycles. Always have. I currently have 4. I subscribe or have subscribed to every cycle magazine. I'm an AMA member. But I cancelled my sub once Cycle World switched to becoming Architectural Cycling Digest. I can't imagine any significant number of motorcyclist want this faux high brow moto-naval-gazing bullshirt.<br /><br />For example: I was very interested in the Yamaha Nikken. And it was the cover story. But good luck finding out what it actually looks like since the design department seems more interested in winning design awards from their friends at Adobe than actually conveying visual information. All the pics of the Nikken were covered with a heavy red filter. At least Rider magazine had a story on the bike the same month and took actual unmolested photos of it so you could see what color it was.<br /><br />And of course nothing says froo-froo design than making type as small as possible. Many of the captions in this version of Cycle World I can't read even with my glasses.  But the run amok designers at CW can do you one even better. In the article on the Yamaha GTS1000 they made them light gray instead of black. Apparently some people over 40 were still able to read some captions and they couldn't have that. Maybe lemon yellow next month.<br /><br />I didn't care that it was expensive but between not being able to read portions of it at all, other parts seeming to be more interested in design for its own sake and the ever increasing amount of moto-naval-gazing I decided to cut my losses. I'm hoping enough others do as well so we can get the good old Cycle World back. You know the one that was about motorcycles first and had regular pictures of them, lots of them.

There is no better magazine out there for staying current with the technological state of the art.<br /><br />Magazines haven't changed--they have to offer something not available anywhere else in order to stay alive.  WIRED has managed to find a seemingly impossible niche as the commentator of choice on cutting-edge technological and societal trends--which, interestingly enough, are most often inextricably combined.  Some articles will be about technological advances, others scientific, some will be purely about the people behind the science--others about how the subject is changing society. It is a measure of the skill of the production team that WIRED has stayed ahead of the trends and manages to hit topical issues regularly and with unmatched depth.  The newsweeklies can't keep up--they are dinosaurs in comparison.<br /><br />WIRED has good editors.  The articles that you hope will go long are usually long--longer than other magazines.

5,Still the best cutting edge hard science fiction and fact out there,"Ignore the bad reviews.  They want to pretend that in the future, there are no gay people, people of color or issues of inequality.  Science fiction has projected current trends into the future since the 19th century.  If you want to have ""hard"" science fiction, you have to deal with the sociological and political trends that are likely to emerge in the future.  If you fail to do this you are limited to space opera military fantasy.  Social and political issues will continue too emerge in the future.  Would be dictators will continue to be a human curse and the threat or actuality of warfare will not stop at the edge of space.  On the other hand, if you are a climate change denialist then Analog is a very uncomfortable place to be as the science fact articles will lay out what we can really expect from high levels of temperature an carbon dioxide increase.  If you are uncomfortable with potential mass starvation or future warfare over scarce resources such as fresh water then you will find Analog uncomfortable.  If you  believe that homosexuality is immoral an that they should be imprisoned, a future that does not find this unusual will find you uncomfortable in Analog and most science fiction for that matter.  As a reader and reviewer of science fiction since the fifties, its a genre that should make you uncomfortable and stretch your perceptions of the world.  An old name for the genre is speculative fiction and that is what the best of it does, it makes you think.  So if your current beliefs are homophobic, in the slightest racist, jingoistic, anti-feminist or generally stuck in the 19th century or perhaps the 8th century, then Analog is not for you.  for the rest of us, while all the stories are never perfect, the gems within these covers are well worth the price of entry.",[],B00005N7VP,B00005N7VP,AGXTFGO7KXIW257RRFLSA3C5VRWA,2022-06-21 00:19:31.636,1,False

Let me tell you, if all you want is to see a magazine chock full of awesome V-Twin custom bikes and you don't care what part of the globe they are from or what badge was on the tank then you better slap yourself down for a subscription to V-Twin magazine.<br />While pouring through a recent issue of V-Twin I find numerous four page spreads on fantastic custom cruisers that include a Kawasaki Vulcan 800, a Yamaha Road Star and a Yamaha Royal Star plus pictures of reader's rides showing a Yamaha Road Star and a Suzuki Intruder.  Of course there are your typical custom Harley entrants including a fantastic Knucklehead and an INSANE custom from Eurocomponants!  There are also heaps of ads for vendors that cater to both the Metric and Harley owners which is nice to see.  And of course there are naturally write-ups on product reviews, wrenching advice, bike events, biking editorials and general bike news geared to the cruiser owner.<br />To me this is a great magazine that doesn't try to push the Harley world down my throat and I don't think I found a disparaging comment towards Metric bikes anywhere which was quite refreshing.  V-Twin isn't about bad ... `tudes, nor is it full of half naked women and profanity, it's all about custom cruisers and doesn't attempt to be anything its not.

This month's issue has a fascinating history of Day-Glo colors and paints, as well as an extended meditation on the color maroon.  This is a quarterly injection of serious and deep intellectual/artistic inquiry and exploration, and while I have a very small (yet growing) platform from which to understand and appreciat this content, I find it engaging, informative and educational.  With every issue I get a little bit smarter, so I figure in another ten years or so I'll know what's going on.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is not an artsy picture-book of art pieces and commentary/review of art and artworks.  It is a much deeper collection of sociological and historical explorations which take place in the context of, or slightly touching upon art.  It is deep and at times convoluted and difficult to follow, but unmistakably interesting and rewarding.",[],B00007KXTL,B00007KXTL,AEVVQH7VM5NFEL47GIXSMP5KVH4Q,2008-10-15 13:03:44.000,2,True

5,Great information on Tech and the Internet,"I have subscribed to this magazine for over four years.  I like that this magazine is constantly fresh and doesn't seem to get stales.  There are always great articles about what is new and upcoming in techonology, new trends on the Internet.  Some magazines have a lot of filler and tend to be a vehicle for selling advertisements.<br /><br />What makes Wired extra special is that they don't pander to products that they do advertising for.  Unlike other computer related magazines they write about trends, and outstanding products.  This leaves them more room for good reporting and less veiled advertising.  They often feature articles written by famous people in techonology.<br /><br />I have operated a cooking website since 1995, so I am familar with the Internet, and how it works.  What I like about Wired magazine is that they constantly write about what's new and upcoming in trends for the online world, and they tend to be very on the mark with where the Internet is and where it is going.<br /><br />If you are interested in techonology, and what is going on online this is the magazine for you.  Wired magazine is fresh, and is free of pandering to the products they help advertise.  I like that this magazine is high on content and low in advertisements.  Always fresh content about new products in techonology, trends in the high tech world, and a good insight on the Internet make this magazine an excellent choice.",[],B00005N7TL,B00005N7TL,AHG34BLPBFJAZLKSZTRSVPBYMNQA,2007-04-15 13:05:56.000,5,False
5,You don't have to have a perfect body for this magazine,"At last a fitness magazine for real people.  I love how this magazine covers many different topics, and often does so in a very realistic way.  To me, magazines like Cosmo and Glamour really don't represent real life.  Nor do they have pictures of real women in the magazine.<br /><br />I like this magazine for inspirational stories about women who got into shape.  Their health articles extend past the symptoms, and often have suggestions on prevention.  Their articles on nutrition are good, and once again realistic.

5,It has recipes you can really use.,"This magazine is completely useful.  It is filled with good recipes you can put together any day of the week.  It features pictures with their recipes so you know what your dinner is susposed to look like.  It also lets you know suggestions and alternatives for what you can do with your left-overs.<br /><br />This magazine has a well rounded assortment of recipes that are meatless, make ahead, and much more.  What I really like is there is also a nice cross section of side dish, salad, dessert recipes along with a couple of informational articles each week.  This is one of the few food magazines that really encourages you to use what you have on hand, and adapt recipes.  Ingredients aren't too exotic that you won't find them.  Instructions are clear and concise.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this recipe magazine to anyone that wants to liven up their day to day cooking, or for someone looking for some new and fresh ideas in cooking.",[],B0000ARXXS,B0000ARXXS,AHG34BLPBFJAZLKSZTRSVPBYMNQA,2004-11-09 20:48:21.000,11,False
4,Fascinating Articles,"I have taken this magazine for about 2 years now, and personally, I enjoy it quite a bit. I am not a native of the New York area, nor have I any affiliations with the fine city. Personally I find the articles to be so well written in the New Yorker it is hard to put down. For me this means the first section of the paper is under appreciated, as its all about New York City, gossip and much more. The articles are of a wide varity of topics and often bring up points that may have had rolling around in your conscious but have never let them bubble up to the top. Fascinating articles can range from politics, famous lives of famous peoples, religious societies, and so much more.<br />This magazine is great if you are a reader. Articles are wordy, and worthwhile. This isn't something your going to be reading just the highlights through. I hardly find myself able to finish a magazine before the next one comes.

4,Good things come in small packages.,"I have taken this magazine for almost three years. While I can not dispute the indepth study of each recipe in this magazine, I wish there was more content in each magazine. I respect that there is no advertising in this magazine, and they take their craft seriously. The back covers are extremely artistic, and of high quality. I have sometimes wished I could frame the back covers.  Articles in the magazine often cover a particular food product and which one with really is the best. Its kind of like Consumer Reports for cooking. I honestly dislike the price, and you can pick up all issues in their annual addition, which I now do. Some of the recipes that I have tried from Cooking Illustrated have been my favorites. If you like in depth coverage on any aspect of your cooking you will adore this magazine.",[],B000069YW9,B000069YW9,AHG34BLPBFJAZLKSZTRSVPBYMNQA,2002-11-14 15:07:08.000,3,False
5,Wonderful Magazine for those that like to cook,"I take several cooking magazines and I like this one the best.  Gourmet seems to have recipes that are a bit gourmand, that need ingredients that you will need to do a search for, while this isn't entirely bad, sometimes you want to make something that is in your cupboards.  I like that these recipes are everyday recipes that have been taken up a level or two.  Articles are informative, with discussing a particular food, ingredient, or technique.  I love the artistic photography.  This strikes me as a balance between Gourmet, and Cooking Illustrated.  This beats cooking illustrated for the photography and the depth of the recipes in each issue.  I highly recommend this one!",[],B00005NIND,B00005NIND,AHG34BLPBFJAZLKSZTRSVPBYMNQA,2002-11-14 15:01:53.000,12,False
3,Interesting Local Reading,"I have somewhat mixed feelings about this magazine, as I can not tell to what type of audience this is truly meant for.  The articles are hard hitting, and well written.  I can not dispute that.  Sometimes I simply don't find them all that interesting. I enjoy the restaurant reviews, its helpful knowing of a few good suggestions when traveling, or even locally.  I find the advertising in the magazine to be a bid auspicious as it seems to cater only to those high members of society that are in serious need of spa treatments and an occasional face lift.  Maybe its tough finding advertising, but I find that it takes away from articles about our local government and issues.<br />I do feel this is totally worth the subscription price, and you are bound to find 12 dollars of reading in a years time :)  This might even be a good gift idea from someone that is no longer in the area.",[],B00005N7T3,B00005N7T3,AHG34BLPBFJAZLKSZTRSVPBYMNQA,2002-01-28 23:53:59.000,17,False
4,"Tons of Ads, and Little Content","This is not my favorite fitness magazine.  This is the size of a Reader's Digest, but is packed with ads just like a Beauty Magazine.

The magazine seems to cover a wide age group, with information that is good for both young and old.  They do offer recipes, workout suggestions, and much more.  The magazine takes little time to read, and seems to only serve as a springboard for more follow up on topics you enjoy.

Secondly this has a section where they feature restaurant recipes, always something that I welcome.  It has information about restaurants.  In addition to all of these things they often share several good recipes each month.  I have always been pleased with their choices.

There are plenty of things under $100 that are pretty and fashionable.<br />I also like that when Marie Claire does a feature about how real women live their lives, it's not a collection of quotes or blurbs like Cosmo or Glamour, it really goes in depth.<br />I can't say enough about this magazine.

But I've read both magazines for many years, and the differences are gradually going down to nothing much.<br /><br />For example, each magazine has always had a contest (send in your coupon to win a free weekend someplace in Britain). The &quot;Britain, The Official Magazine&quot; contest, at one time, could only be entered by citizens of Britain. Now, both magazines are owned by the same company, and they both have the same contest, which is available to all and now includes international air fare as part of the prize.<br /><br />Each magazine is 100 pages.

5,Photos and Illustrations of National Geographic Quality!,"We've gotten &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine for many years, but it's just this year that I even heard of &quot;National Geographic History.&quot; So I had to try it out.<br /><br />I read quite a bit of history, and I'm enjoying this magazine. It is a sort of history-lite. Sometimes that's good, because you can just grab it and read a whole article when you only have a few minutes to spare. The downside, of course, is that the articles aren't in-depth. BUT, the language and concepts are not dumbed down and, as you'd expect from the National Geographic brand, the photos and illustrations are top of the line. And as N.G. History is large format (compared to regular National Geographic) there is a lot of space to show off great photos and detailed illustrations.<br /><br />I love learning new stuff. For example, did you know that the reason Mary Wollstoncraft Godwin and her friends were stuck inside the house telling ghost stories was due to &quot;bizarre weather in 1816&quot;? The year before, the Mount Tambora volcano erupted in Indonesia, releasing &quot;vast amounts [of] ash, rock, and sulfuric dust into the air.... Reports of odd weather came in from all quarters in 1816.&quot; The year 1816 became &quot;the year without a summer&quot; and without that volcano, there may have been no &quot;Frankenstein!&quot;<br /><br />Do you like Egyptology? There's a great article on the discovery of Queen Ahhotep's Theban tomb in 1859. Read about the queen, including lovely photos of her sarcophagus and jewelry. I got a kick out of a sidebar concerning Napoleon III's wife, Empress Eugenie. The Ahhotep jewels were loaned to the Universal Exhibition in Paris, 1867. The Empress was so impressed that &quot;she asked the viceroy of Egypt to give them to her. Alarmed, Auguste Mariette, the director of Egyptian antiquities and discoverer of Ahhotep's treasures, hurriedly sent them back to Cairo.&quot; He had good reason to fear. I remember reading about the English Queen Mary, who had a habit of visiting people's houses and admiring their knick-knacks. Protocol at the time required that the owner give her item she admired. She did it so often, people started hiding their objects d'art when they heard she was coming over.<br /><br />I've received two issues so far, May/June and July/August 2017. Articles range from 2 pages to 16 ages, and cover a wide variety of topics. To give you an idea of the wide scope, here's the feature (longer) articles in the two issues:<br />... Altimara, Spanish cave paintings<br />... The Fearsome Queens of Thebes, who united Egypt<br />... War and Peace in Homer's &quot;Iliad&quot;<br />... Octavian's Rise to the Top, the Roman emperor<br />... A Cook's Tour, Captain James Cook's first voyage to Australia<br />... The Hieroglyphic Puzzle, cracking the code<br />... Agatha Christie in Mesopotamia, with her 2nd husband Max Mallowan<br />... The Truth About Archimedes, stories true or false?<br />... The Roman Underground, catacombs<br />... The Testimony of Notre-Dame de Paris, how it tells the story of France<br />... Amerigo Vespucci, his true and not-so-true tales of the new continent<br /><br />And that doesn't include the shorter articles. Each magazine is 96 pages stuffed full of fascinating information. For me, this magazine is 5 stars. Just don't expect it to be scholarly instead of entertaining.<br /><br />Happy Reader","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81OFwBh++vL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81OFwBh++vL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81OFwBh++vL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81k7PGnXWTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81k7PGnXWTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81k7PGnXWTL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01F2MKW0I,B01F2MKW0I,AFSIVZMMUEWXWTBFVJSFRIPRYMKA,2017-07-09 20:00:56.370,401,True
5,Great Variety in a Classy Package!,"This is &#34;The Strand Magazine&#34; rebooted, published out of Michigan four times a year. You may have heard of the original &#34;The Strand&#34; – published in England from 1891 – 1950. It's the magazine in which the Sherlock Holmes stories were first serialized.<br /><br />I'm a long-time fan and subscriber to the new American Strand, first published in 1998. There used to be many magazines in America dedicated to publishing short stories, a good proportion of them specializing in mysteries & thrillers (and pulp). Now we're down to a handful.<br /><br />And I like &#34;The Strand&#34;. It's over sized, almost 11 ½&#34; x 8 ½&#34;. The pages are glossy. Each issue arrives in a plastic wrapper, so the pages aren't bent around in the mail. Every style of mystery/thriller writing is covered, whether it's in the short stories themselves, the interviews, the reviews or the ads. And occasionally they offer a story that is not really a mystery, but has merit.<br /><br />I have in front of me the last two issues, Oct2015/Jan2016 and Feb/May2016. I'll give you a little synopsis of what's in these two issues. Not every story is a home-run for me, but I do read each issue from cover to cover, usually 80 oversized pages. The links I've provided are to a publication by each author currently available on amazon. I included these links in case you are unfamiliar with the authors; you can check out the type of writing you may expect.<br /><br />Often, the interviews are just as interesting as the stories. The interviews are all conducted by Managing Editor Andrew Gulli. You can tell he enjoys his job.<br /><br />Each issue has 12-13 reviews by various mystery & thriller lovers. They are in-depth and cover, as you'd expect, mostly adult books. But they also review new publications of young adult mysteries, recorded books and DVD issues.<br /><br />Last of all, I love going through all the ads in each issue, too. I always find at least three new books to order for that quarter, books I might not have otherwise come to my attention. This is good for my reading enjoyment but bad for my pocketbook.<br /><br />Oct2015/Jan2016<br />AUTHORS OF FICTION STORIES PRESENTED<br />1.  William Faulkner, a previously un-published one-act play<br />2.  Andrea Camilleri  [[ASIN:0143121626 Montalbano's First Case and Other Stories (Inspector Montalbano Series)]]<br />3.  John M.

Alexander McCall Smith  [[ASIN:1400034779 The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency (Book 1)]]  I have the whole series.<br />INTERVIEWS<br />A.  Dean Koontz. Great quote: &#34;I tend to write several books from a similar approach and then move on to something I find more challenging.... I have been told at least twenty times that one book or another was so different it would blow up my career; I should have long ago been reduced to fine-grain debris, but I've hung in all this time. Which is a good thing, because I have no other talents or skills. I would have had to turn to a life of crime. And I expect my criminal aptitude would make Donald Westlake's [John]] Dortmunder look like a modern-day Moriarty.&#34;<br />B.  A.E. Hotchner. He has had an amazing career, starting with meeting Hemingway to do an interview for &#34;Cosmopolitan&#34;. He's published biographies, memoirs and written plays. Last but not least, he co-founded, with the late Paul Newman, both Newman's Own and Hole in the Wall Gang.<br /><br />Feb/May2016<br />AUTHORS OF FICTION STORIES PRESENTED<br />1.  James Thurber, a previously unpublished short story<br />2.  Jefferey Deaver, part 1 of a 2-parter  [[ASIN:0451469798 The Bone Collector: The First Lincoln Rhyme Novel]] Very well written, but not for the faint-hearted.<br />3.  Max Colliins & Mickey Spillane  [[ASIN:1617735965 The Big Showdown (A Caleb York Western)]]<br />4.  O'Neil De Nouox  [[ASIN:B014XA0LJC The Long Cold (LaStanza Series Book 8)]]<br />5.

He is one of the co-creators and writers of the &#34;Sherlock&#34; British TV show starring Benedict Cumberbatch.<br />B.  Heather Graham. A prolific writer with a couple mystery series, though she's best known for romances.<br /><br />That should be enough to whet your appetite! If there is anything I'd improve with &#34;The Strand&#34; it is the story illustrations. They tend to be uninteresting. BUT – that is a quibble which does not wobble my enjoyment of this magazine.<br /><br />Happy Reader","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81MGZB8OyeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81MGZB8OyeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81MGZB8OyeL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B000062XRV,B000062XRV,AFSIVZMMUEWXWTBFVJSFRIPRYMKA,2016-05-06 08:22:15.000,25,True
5,Intelligent Creative Informative Writing For All Ages!,"My son received a gift subscription to this magazine two years ago, and each year since, he's asked for a renewal subscription.  If he didn't get it himself, I would be sorely tempted to subscribe to it for myself.  The articles are accessible to kids, but not so dumbed down to be condescending.  Some of the articles I've copied out and given to whom-ever I can (and I mean adults) because they're so darn interesting and I-didn't-know-that!  Highly recommended for the young enquiring mind and the parent of the same!<br /><br />//////// Above is my original review, published in 2007. Now it's 2016, and my son is in college.<br />We hadn't subscribed to Dig for several years, when, on a whim, I just got myself a subscription. I must say, this is still a 5 star magazine for me. I didn't give a lot of detail in my 2007 review, so I'll tell some about the latest issue: February 2016, with the main topic of &#34;Istanbul Through Time&#34;.<br /><br />The quality of the articles is very good. &#34;Dig&#34; has staff writers and each issue has Consulting Editors depending on the topic. The writing is geared towards kids but it is not dumbed down. For example, here's the first paragraph of the 1st article, &#34;Location Location, Location&#34;, by Emily Abbink, anthropologist, who teaches history and anthropology and history at the University of California, Santa Cruz:<br />&#34;Any real estate agent will tell you that the three keys to picking a good place to live are 'location, location, location.' Traveling back more than 2,500 years, we find that, instead of a realtor, ancient sources say Prince Byzas from the Greek city-state of Megara consulted the oracle of Delphi for advice about founding a new trading settlement. The oracle instructed him to locate opposite the 'Land of the Blind.' The advice turned out to be an excellent real estate tip.&#34;<br /><br />How the Prince interprets &#34;Land of the Blind&#34; is very interesting. But that's half the fun with prophesies.<br /><br />I'm saving this particular issue, because I'd love to visit Turkey and Istanbul one day. &#34;Dig&#34; gives me more information than the usual guidebook. Oh to see the Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque and the Basilica Cistern. The last is called a &#34;sunken palace&#34; because of its size, and worth it just to see the Medusa head reused as a pillar base.<br /><br />I continue to recommend &#34;Dig Into History&#34;.<br />1. You get your history, archeology and anthropology in small doses. This makes it easy to plop down and read a little bit when you don't have the time or inclination to settle in with a heavy tome.<br />2.  Magazine articles are up-to-date. Your current issue has the most recent information on the topic.<br />3.  High quality writing, maps, photos, pictures, comics, cartoons, puzzles and sidebars. For example, We're not just told how massive the city walls were, we're given a full page illustration and a photo of a surviving section.<br /><br />Happy Reader","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YNaI39AfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YNaI39AfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YNaI39AfL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91vQMfNCdIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91vQMfNCdIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91vQMfNCdIL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B000071FIR,B000071FIR,AFSIVZMMUEWXWTBFVJSFRIPRYMKA,2007-06-02 22:21:20.000,45,False

5,One magine you should not be without.,"There are two magazines on woodworking that no one should be without; Woodsmith and Fine Woodworking. Both are excellent and I have every issue.<br />I missed a couple of years of Woodsmith because I thought I was not going to do much in woodworking again since I also have other hobbies, and the house we have now is too full with furniture I made from both magazines, and of my own design. Now we are building a new house, my interest has been renewed, and that is what I did again with Woodsmith, I started up the subscription again. As soon as I figure out where I left off, I will be getting the back issues I missed, or the DVD (which I got recently with the FW magazine, well worth it too, so I might spring for the Woodsmith DVD).<br /><br />The pages are thick, not flimsy like other magazines, and will last a lifetime. The first issue of Woodsmith is still as new as ever, and I have been keeping them all in the binders they also sell; helps keep everything in one place and the binders are very nice too, they have a slight padding inside the vinyl of the face and back of the binder.<br /><br />I have built many projects from Woodsmith, including a secretary bookcase in a Chippendale style, where the bottom of the desk came from Woodsmith, the top from FW. Without these magazines, I would not have been able to do either, so that alone is worth every penny I spent on the subscriptions. Of course, I have built several other projects too.

5,Without Question One of the Best Photography Magazines on the Market!,"The magazine market is absolutely flooded with various photography related magazines. Honestly, it seems like each year that passes there is at least 1 new photography magazine out there added to the mix. I'm a professional architectural photographer, but I also shoot for myself as well (mainly landscape and urban landscape style pictures). I still shoot film 99% of the time as I mainly shoot large format (4x5 & 8x10) and I still make all of my prints in the darkroom. Most of my enjoyment regarding photography actually comes after I shoot the picture as I absolutely love working in the darkroom making prints. Platinum & Palladium printing and Lith printing are some of my favorite printing methods. The problem with that, at least in regards to magazines, is that most photography related magazines now focus on digital photography and I really have no interest in digital photography. I know that's not a popular opinion these days considering the photography market is now dominated by digital, but there has actually been a slow movement back to film over the last 5+ years. The Impossible project and the fact that Polaroid is now easily purchased again is just one example of people going back to film based photography.<br /><br />Anyways, there are really only a few magazines these days that still focus on film based photography and even those magazines usually don't focus just on film based photography. The best one can really hope for these days is a magazine that covers both digital and film based photography and in that regard, B&W is without question one of the best photography magazines on the market. Not only does B&W still cover film based photography, the quality of the artwork in B&W is outstanding. Its usually on par with the quality you see in magazines like Aperture & View Camera magazine. I do shoot color commercially as that is what most of my clients want, but when shooting for myself I always shoot B&W. Personally, I find color to be distracting. Black & white photography  just has a timeless beauty to it and B&W magazine does a fantastic job at highlighting artists that excel at shooting B&W photography. IMO, B&W is easily in the top 3 photography magazines on the market.<br /><br />Bottom line - if your looking for a high quality photography magazine that focuses on black and white photography, B&W is EASILY one of the best choices you can make. This is the kind of magazine you wind up keeping even after you read it and that is really the best compliment I can give it as there are only 3 photography magazines that I wind up collecting like that, Aperture, View Camera, and B&W. All of the other photography magazines I subscribe to wind up in the recycling bin when I'm done reading them. If your a fan of black & white photography this is easily one of the best option you can make regarding magazines.<br /><br />5 Stars!!",[],B009NLKSJ0,B009NLKSJ0,AENOV7PVFKAMLSU624FFLLB3EHAQ,2018-01-13 17:01:02.660,3,False
5,A Must For All Serious Xbox Players.,"I really dont understand all of the negative reviews this magazine gets. I have never had a problem with late issues, damaged or missing discs, or even damaged magazines. My magazine shows up pretty much the same time every month in pristine condition. I have actually subscribed to this magazine since its first year when the original Xbox was the magazines focus and I really haven't had a single problem in all that time. In fact, I still have all my magazines and game discs and was recently thinking about selling them on eBay.<br /><br />Overall the magazine is well written and the game disc is really nice, especially for those that dont have access to Xbox live as there are always 4-6 new demo's on each new disc. I do have Xbox Live Gold and I still enjoy the discs. Of course this is a magazine specifically for the Xbox360 so its going to be a little biased. Every game magazine in existence that caters to specific consoles are guilty of this practice. Its just the way things are done in this industry. The Magazines that cater to Nintendo and the PS3 are no different. In fact, I find Playstation Magazine to be the worst of the lot in this regards. Subtracting .5 points from the major releases usually gives a more accurate score.<br /><br />Bottom line - This is one of the magazines I look forward to the most each month and that is saying something as we currently subscribe to over 60 magazines at my house and that is not a joke. I actually tip my mailman at Christmas for all the magazines he has to deliver to our house, lol. OXM has everything you expect from a great gaming magazine. It has great gaming articles, quality reviews, in depth previews, and a game disc that contains review scores for all the games ever released and demo's for games, usually anywhere from 4-6 games per disc.<br /><br />Amazon doesn't let us mention specific prices so ill simply say that the price I have paid for this magazine the last 3 years running has been so cheap that I literally couldn't even by a Big Mac value meal with the money. IMO this magazine is worth the regular Amazon price so getting a killer deal just makes it that much better.<br /><br />This is the magazine to get if your a big 360 gamer.<br /><br />5 stars.",[],B003UCULA4,B003UCULA4,AENOV7PVFKAMLSU624FFLLB3EHAQ,2011-01-15 04:46:13.000,2,True

5,A great way to start a lifelong passion for reading!,"I was introduced to Cricket magazine through one of my teachers in early elementary school, and soon afterward my parents began a subscription for me. From then all the way up through middle school I devoured each issue cover-to-cover the moment it arrived. At first I found it a welcome challenge compared to the overly simple and mundane classroom books of the ""Mac the cat sat on a mat"" variety. Even after I had surpassed the magazine in my reading ability, I continued to enjoy it for the content of the stories. Even my mother loved to read it.<br />The magazine provides a great collection of well-selected stories that open up an entire world for the young reader, and each issue usually has a particular theme (i.e. the Middle Ages, horses, Chinese culture, food, etc.). Some of the stories are excerpted from longer pieces and some are short works in their own right. The magazine spans all genres of literature; includes both fiction, non-ficiton, and poetry; and addresses such important themes as culture, history, family and friends, growing up, and much more. Some pieces have serious and valuable morals, while others are just plain fun.<br />The magazine also offers book recommendations, a comic strip, a crossword puzzle, jokes, and contests for art, photography, fiction, and poetry. Moreover, each issue is beautifully illustrated. I believe the artwork in this magazine did much to inspire my own early artistic endeavors. I would highly recommend this magazine to parents and teachers alike. The stories are excellent material for young readers, and would also be great to read aloud to children. On the whole, this is a terrific blend of recreation and education! The makers of Cricket also offer other magazines for different age levels - Spider, Ladybug, and Babybug for the younger ones, and Cicada for adolescents.",[],B00006FXOO,B00006FXOO,AHB454ZGQQJY2GZY7J3KE4RVT6BA,2004-02-16 16:00:50.000,109,False

From how to properly wax a vehicle to constructing a firepit to silencing squeaky floors, it can all be done by you or by me.

2,Magazine USE to be 98 pages.  They have reduced the pages from 98 to 66!. The cover even fell off.  Very disappointing.,"Just a friendly heads up:  I had been getting this magazine for close to two years.  Maybe a little more.  Every single issue had EXACTLY 98 pages; that is, until I got my Spring issue, which was so thin, I wondered if some pages had fallen out!  The cover ended up falling off.  Turns out, they had reduced the number of pages by, and this is a partial quote from the editors letter, &#34;a few pages.&#34;  The Spring issue was 66 pages.  32 pages is NOT a few pages. Does the editor really think we can't count?<br /><br />I could completely understand if the magazine were a few pages less, but 32 is not a few.  That is a BIG difference and the cover wouldn't even stay on.  It literally fell off. And this magazine was a replacement because my previous magazines cover was not even attached when I got it!<br /><br />TO BE FAIR:  This magazine did have some wonderful ideas, stories, tips, advice and pictures.  I always enjoyed it, very much.  But I feel cheated, because this is NOT a cheap subscription and to make such a drastic change in the number of pages is absurd and ridiculous.<br /><br />I immediately cancelled my subscription and will never order this magazine again, and I do not recommend it.<br /><br />UPDATE:  7/10/18:<br /><br />To our readers,<br />After producing CardMaker magazine for many years now, we will be ceasing publication after the winter 2017 issue.

My other favorite part is that every recipe comes with nutrition facts.<br /><br />Aside from that, I have mixed feelings.  If you currently eat the standard American diet, I think this magazine could be a great fit.  If you're a vegetarian, I think you'll still find a good portion of the recipes appealing.  After that it gets tricky.  When I subscribed I was a vegetarian still eating a fair amount of cheese and milk so it was a great fit.  But I'm finding in my health journey that eliminating meat and exercising is not enough to contain my cholesterol and blood pressure :)  So these days very few of the recipes appeal to me as a fair portion contain meat, and most of the rest contain cheese or yogurt or some other dairy product, but I can understand that many people don't need to go that far to achieve health.<br /><br />Another great note, the recipes use pretty common ingredients and don't take a huge time investment.  The other cooking magazine I had subscribed to (Vegetarian) didn't have a problem using ingredients that you had to scout around for, and some of the recipes could be time consuming.. and a little froo-froo if you know what I mean.

This “coverage”  tends to double the size of some articles without adding anything substantive..  I love the original journalism and the grand overview of current business issues.

4,Parent pleaser,"I too wanted a news magazine that went beyond the usual American celebutante pseudo-news.  I'm interested in economics, but am a lay person who is less interested in high finance and investments, and more interested in the stories of our times.  The Economist has been a real gem.  It is a hefty magazine, and I'm not sure how well I will keep up with it... I wish it was (were?) a biweekly.<br /><br />I think its British perspective is very useful especially because Americans tend to forget that there really is a world out there (aside from the Middle East and British Royals).  It is good to read about ourselves as just another piece of the puzzle.  The articles seem well written, much better than most, such that the style does not interfere with the content.  In that it reminds me of much of the Wall Street Journal newspaper, which I always find well written. (For the record, at this time my favorite magazines are Christian Century and Ode.)<br /><br />I look forward to introducing my children and others to this magazine.  I think it has a lot to offer and I hope that more people will read it.  If I were to change anything about it (aside from making it a biweekly so I could keep up) it would be to have a section where the wider news stories are followed up with examples of their particular effects!

2,2.5 stars. i am surprised that this mag has a 4-star rating on here.,"i have been reading GW since it came out and have kept most of my issues from the 80's and some from the 90's and 00's. at their peak of greatness they offered 5 brand new tabs every month. we now get 3 tabs, only one of which is new (trust me, i have the old issues with other 2 tabs in them). i get it, tabs can be found on the net for free and GW doesn't want to pay someone for hours of transcription work. i am sure that isn't cheap. however, there are loads of good songs that have never been transcribed or are poorly tabbed online. GW could get some fan base back by researching these and then paying someone to tab them out. and/or do a poll of your readers and ask them quarterly what songs they most want to see tabbed. the mag isn't all bad. the lessons are really cool and the articles are well written. after i frown at what songs are tabbed, listed on the cover, i am brightened up by the articles and gear reviews.",[],B000NDESLQ,B000NDESLQ,AGCHJ5AGWIZIK3KDTAJ7FS3NFNDQ,2016-08-29 15:17:05.000,5,True

5,"Great, appropriate reading","I subscribed to this magazine from around age 7 to age 12, and also got my hands on many back issues during that time.<br /><br />It is a wonderful, advertising-free magazine with everything from advice, to crafts, to parties (yes, they are kind of heavy on that).<br /><br />They oftentimes offer excerpts form books from American Girl Press - but they are excerpts which are useful in their own right, not just getting you to buy the book. They are such things as a few crafts out a a craft book, a quiz or two from a quiz book, and that sort of thing. I also highly recommend these books, but that is beside the point.<br /><br />They interview a lot of girls in special circumstances or doing good for their community, anything from girls to volunteer to girls who were adopted and talk about that, to disabled girls. The stories are always age-appropriate and try to inspire readers to do good fir their world.<br /><br />They also have much advice on a variety of subjects, from things that readers write in to advice from the writers. They cover such topics as difficult friendships, moving, braces, school trouble, pets, whatever - all kinds of relevant issues.<br /><br />They also offer advice on things to do - they often have themed 'parties' where they offer activities, food, etc. for fun slumber parties. While I never threw one of these elaborate extravaganzas, much of it can be adapted for girls having fun with friends or family. They also offer crafts, recipes, and the like for other things to do.<br /><br />When I got the magazine, I can count on one hand the number of celebrity interviews there were, and they were always short and not the focus of the magazine.<br /><br />Also, there are always short fictional stories, contests, reader letters, and miscellaneous things, perfect for most preteen and slightly younger girls.<br /><br />It is a very white magazine, though.

There is no depth, no real meat to this.  Our family was so disappointed we canceled our subscription and asked for our money back.

1,So disappointed,"Been looking for a magazine for my newly teen-ed daughter/nieces/friends.  This is not it.<br /><br />I purchased and we read through one issue.  My daughter said, ""Yuck""  I feel the same -- almost Cosmo-jr feel to it.  I read the reviews previously posted and have to agree with the one who said this mag has gone seriously down hill.<br /><br />I disliked the fact that 2/3 of the issue we looked at was about prom -- dresses, makeup, turning down the boy you don't like, ideas for parties, ideas for manicures, the perfect hair style, etc.  Where's the story about ideas for if you're NOT going to prom?  How to face disappointment of boy you like who doesn't ask you?  It was so superficial and emphasized (and photo'd) perfect, pretty, expensive, and boy-crazy.<br /><br />The write in questions make me wonder who selected them? Just an overall bad impression of this magazine that puts pressure on girls to be popular, skinny, made-up, high heeled, and shallow.<br /><br />The only possible saving attribute was a 2 page spread on book recommendations.  However, every book rec was a sci fi romance!  All vampires, werewolves, witches, and other supernaturals.  Again, it had possibilities but fell through.<br /><br />So NOT going to give this to my daughter or any of her friends.",[],B00024CY7Q,B00024CY7Q,AGUUMSTCOVGXSUYRWG3Q7WHQH66A,2013-05-26 18:40:32.000,38,False

1,"FIVE STARS FOR THE MAGAZINE, BUT BEWARE OF FUTURE OFFERS","The information in this MAGAZINE is a joy to read and includes current non-fictional information, biographies, jokes, photos, and so much more.  It’s smaller size makes it handy to keep in a purse or larger pocket.  There is even a large print version.<br />We had been RD subscribers for years prior to moving, so when Amazon offered this offer, we eagerly signed up for ONE subscription.<br />(However we received TWO subscriptions!)<br /><br />Why only ONE STAR?  The RD magazine would get 4 or 5; however we gave it only ONE as a warning.  Our subscription, as mentioned in other reviews, initiated a ton of junk mail offers for additional products/books arrived by e-mail and by USPS!  There was no requirement to buy these products, but let’s face it, junk mail appropriately earned it’s name.  But, the nightmare got worse!<br />We recently received a package containing a book (untitled) that was the first volume of many to follow.  The book cost $10+ tax, but was free for the first  volume, $0.00. There was no price listed for the following untitled books.  NOR was there any way to opt out of further issues!!! The [only] ONE instruction included and was to return the “payment slip” with a check (bank information).  Talk about the RED FLAGS for FRAUD!!!<br /><br />Please note:  The company requesting this information was not Reader’s Digest nor Amazon... another red flag.

Who needs a magazine when you can read all day for free at many sites on the web or at the library? I still subscribe to Reader's Digest but even it is starting to annoy me. It still has enough interesting stories for me to continue until they to exceed my tolerance for ads or start adding color backgrounds behind text so I can't read it anymore.

All the snippets of text and longer articles are fun to read and something to sit down with.  The pictures are beautiful and captured with attention to small details.  The ideas for decorating inspire me also because I go for rustic cottage appeal that integrates modern touches here and there for updating and staying with the current.

Now, I'm not saying this sort of thing doesn't happen in the world, but I sure do not support it and do not want to spend my hard earned money to read about women who need psychological help or a better moral compass.  Does media follow society or does society fuel the media?  I think it's definitely both... but I know a good way to rectify it.

4,Get your MBA here!,"I'm not one of those downhill-at-a-45-degree-angle types, but I do have a vintage 1997 GT Aggressor hard-tail mountain bike, bought new back then, and I just can't let go of it. It's light CrMo frame is tough as nails, and the RST front shocks, Shimano Deore V-brakes, Deore rear derailleur, and Deore rapidfire shifters have never been replaced. It's now on its fourth gel seat, third set of pedals and second set of nubby Tioga Psycho tires.<br /><br />Maybe one of the reasons that this bike has lasted is that it is kept maintained, and one of the sources that I use for tips is [[ASIN:B00006KOMK Mountain Bike Action]], also known as MBA to MTB enthusiasts. For those new to the sport, MTB is an acronym for MounTain Biking, so now you know.<br /><br />Some of their How-To articles are just common sense reminders, while others give us new food for thought. As an example, there was a 2005 article entitled ""10 Ways To Stay Up In Sand"" that offered some excellent tips on staying on the top of the granules, floating across the surface, and stay seated unless one hit a section of granular powder at speed.<br /><br />Another that appeared in the summer of this year was ""Top 11 Tire Tips by Kenda,"" which should be read by all cyclists in its entirety, especially for its common-sense tips on how to avoid tire pinch-flatting. If you don't have the issue, check their site online and see if it's not still there.<br /><br />Their MTB news is generally interesting, and usually up to date. The bike tests are generally interesting, even if just for the information on how the current gear has improved... or dropped in quality. Of particular interest are their product reviews, which can cover anything from tools to gloves to hydration gear.<br /><br />This magazine, along with [[ASIN:B001B6NAW2 Park Tool The Big Blue Book of Repair - 2nd Edition]] are all one could ask for in terms of keeping ones MTB in good shape, and my own aging bike is a good example of that. If you need a simpler bike repair reference [[ASIN:1579548830 The Bicycling Guide to Complete Bicycle Maintenance and Repair: For Road and Mountain Bikes]] is an excellent choice, especially if you're trying to teach kids about bike maintenance, and it's now available in its expanded and revised 5th edition.<br /><br />The venerable [[ASIN:B000OPOEDU Bicycling]] magazine from Rodale has been around for many years, but its focus is more towards the road rider as opposed to the mountain biker. Rodale also publishes 'Mountain Bike' (subscription unavailable here as of this writing), but I'll personally give 'Mountain Bike Action' a slight edge for overall content. If you're looking for a publication with more ""meaty"" content, you may want to consider [[ASIN:B000071FJO Dirt Mountain Bike Magazine]], a true diehard downhill mountain bike magazine, but be prepared to pay a higher price for this 5-star publications.<br /><br />Is MBA a perfect MTB enthusiast magazine? No, not by any means, for like most monthly publications these days, there are too many pages filled with advertising, and that's why I've rated it at 4-stars. But from the mountain biking magazines available at a somewhat reasonable price today, it's one of the best.",[],B00006KOMK,B00006KOMK,AFOYRQEWLCJEFYV6I64L7S2WLETQ,2008-11-07 20:06:03.000,6,False
3,Bicycling Magazine: a shadow of what it was...,"[[ASIN:B000OPOEDU Bicycling]] has portrayed itself as is the ""world's leading cycling magazine,"" and this may be true, but the quality of this publication has been slowly declining over the years. My personal interests in cycling are more directed at mountain and trail cycling, but this magazine, in publication since the '60s, was always a welcome source of information about non-motorized two-wheeled sports.<br /><br />I started subscribing to this periodical years ago. It's articles and reviews used to have substance, and each issue was worth exploring from cover to cover. The magazine's coverage of Lance Armstrong and his multiple championships was exceptional. It was between the covers of this magazine that I first learned about Armstrong's then-new book [[ASIN:0399146113 It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life]], and knew that I had to get a copy.<br /><br />But that was then, and this is now. 'Bicycling' is from Rodale, a company that publishes some of the better health and wellness magazines, including 'Prevention,' 'Men's Health,' 'Women's Health,' 'Runner's World,' and 'Mountain Bike.' At one time I subscribed to both 'Bicycling' and 'Mountain Bike,' but no longer. Both of these seem to be a (thin) shadow of the meaty publications they used to be. For MTB articles, I do prefer [[ASIN:B00006KOMK Mountain Bike Action]], and find a bit more substance there. If your focus is mostly toward road bikes, [[ASIN:B00007B9CL Cycling Plus]] has a lot more meat, though at a higher cost.<br /><br />I don't mind all of the advertising, which does seem to dominate most consumer magazines today, but just wish that the articles, reviews and news items had more depth than those available on the 'Net these days. I'll still continue to pick up singler issues of 'Bicycling' when the occasional article looks interesting, but can't justify subscribing unless there's some extraordinarily special rate being offered.",[],B000OPOEDU,B000OPOEDU,AFOYRQEWLCJEFYV6I64L7S2WLETQ,2008-11-07 18:49:58.000,14,True

But, hopefully, better than my current issue to Rolling Stone, I'll actually read my printed versions of these dynamic duo mags. I already won a subscripts to the online version of ""Out's Advocate"". I have not taken to reading magazines online that is why I'm trying the printed versions. It's really quite remarkable and sad the way the World Wide Web continues to destroy so many businesses. On the one hand, its kinda fun being able to make your online travel arrangements. But when it comes to other media, like music, while I like the portability of Mp3s, I cannot acclimate myself to reading album booklets online. Same as magazines. Maybe we will learn that somethings need to retain a tactical experience. We still have to formulate digital manners, the few attempts to introduce some, have mostly gone unheeded. We still see Neanderthals speaking loudly on cellphones in public places or simply ignoring cashiers as they check out.

3,Don't allow cancellation - so be sure you want it,"I've been picking up Mojo Magazine off the newsstand when available and it's a decent music magazine. I also enjoy the accompanying CDs. However, after ordering a one year subscription, I decided I wanted to cancel for now and emailed them via the email address provided in the subscription confirmation letter. The response I got is that it isn't their (Great Magazines) policy to allow the cancellation of a subscription. I have subscribed to many magazines over the years and while there certainly may be others who have that policy, I have never encountered one. That is not to say it's my habit to cancel subscriptions - it isn't. But I have cancelled a sub maybe 2 or 3 times over the years and have never had a problem. They simply pro-rate and refund the difference. So, since this magazine, which is published out of Great Britain, is an expensive subscription, make sure you really want it because you can't cancel it. I should say that I got my subscription directly from the Mojo website. Had I known Amazon handled it, I probably would have ordered it through them and maybe the policy would be different. In any case, there was nothing on the Mojo site when ordering the subscription that stated the non-cancellation policy. Just information for anyone considering this magazine.

Too much now is about frivolous celebrity culture, devoid of any cigar-related content.  If I had the slightest interest in how some actor/singer/athlete lives, I would read one of those magazines.

1,Didn’t like the issue it was boring..,"Where are the recipes!!!??? The issue I finally receiced after 3-4 months and it wasn’t great. That being said I’m not aloud to mention how poorly my experience subscribing on Amazon was. I’m also not aloud to mention that I didn’t receive the magazine for like 3 almost 4 months. But after I canceled the subscription, a magazine did actually arrived a week or 2 later. But it wasn’t a great issue, it was boring. I was hoping I made it on time for the holiday issue, but I didn’t. So I had regretted not purchasing at the store. I don’t recommend subscribing to this magazine especially through here, I say just buy it on the news stands when it’s an interesting issue. Anyway I don’t like that veg news is more about celebrities now. I will support veg news because sometimes their issues are good and it’s a vegan magazine. But I won’t be subscribing again, I regretted that decision. I did eventually get fully refunded though. I had cancelled because it took way too long to receive the magazine.<br />-I manage to find the holiday issue, but not what I had expected at all! This is a huge catalog to buy more junk food and vegan garbage! I was hoping for some cheeze recipes, but nothing. The issue does have very few recipes, but the way it’s organize it is so badly done!

1,"Those Were the Days, My Friend, We Thought They'd Never End...","I can remember the day like it was yesterday; I was at Thrifty Drugstore and I glanced over the magazine rack. There was a copy of Muscle & Fitness. On the cover was a glossy color picture of Dennis Tinerino and some blonde babe. I was so incredibly impressed by that body! Hers wasn't too shabby, either.<br /><br />I felt kind of embarrassed buying that magazine because I was, at the time, 6'1"" and weighed 106 pounds. I had real long, blonde hair and so I had to be really careful not to stand in corners because people might've mistaken me for a mop and used me to try and clean their floors.<br /><br />I remember reading that magazine cover to cover. It was pure inspiration which was sorely lacking in my personal universe at the time. I was 15 years old and I felt abandoned by life. I really didn't feel like I fit in anywhere.<br /><br />But after reading that magazine, I dragged out my dad's old blue plastic York barbells and dumbells and his old Sears weight bench and set up a little place in the garage and started working out. At first, I didn't want anyone to know so when everyone was fast asleep, I'd tiptoe to the garage, turn on my Realistic Stereo from Radio Shack to three and workout from 1-2 in the morning.<br /><br />This magazine really offered some great advice at the time but what I really liked were the pictures. Bodybuilding  wasn't the 'freakshow' that it is today. There were some massive guys, but there weren't guys walking around at 300lbs with 25"" biceps. Bodybuilding back then still had style and class. I immediately took a liking to Frank Zane. He wasn't super huge, but his body looked like it was sculpted from pure granite. One time the Mr. Olympia was on ABC sports and I used the Beta-tape player (remember those?) to tape his posing routine. Every morning and every night I watched that tape until it literally disentegrated from so much viewing.<br /><br />I finally ""went public"" with working out because people began to notice that something was different. In fact, I got to play on the football team instead of being used as a yardage marker. Muscle & Fitness was still my Bible and I ordered all kinds of Weider related products. I once saved up my allowance for a month to get a container of chocolate 'gain weight pills'...I bought them because the same guy that was oin the cover of the first M&F I bought, Dennis Tinerino, was also peddling these. I thought for sure that if I took those pills, I'd look like him in another six or seven weeks.<br /><br />God, those pills were awful.<br /><br />I graduated from the garage to a real gym when I was 16 and I kept making progress. Bodybuilding took over my life. Even though my self esteem improved somewhat, it was hard to let go of all those mean and horrible things other kids used to say to me. I thought if I could just get to 160lbs...if I could just get to 175lbs...if I could just get to 200lbs...then I would be happy.<br /><br />But I was never happy.<br /><br />I started taking steroids right after I graduated high school and I still wasn't making the gains I wanted to.<br /><br />One night, in a ""roid rage"" I was involved in a pretty horrible car accident. My right arm was almost completely torn off. My arm was spared but I was despondent because I couldn't go to the gym.<br /><br />When I was finally able to go back to the gym, I returned to the same old tricks. I began to notice that Muscle & Fitness was saying the same old thing. I began to get really disillusioned about bodybuilding. I stopped lifting altogether. I distanced myself as much as possible from the sport.<br /><br />About ten years ago, I gradually got back into it. Not to where I once was, but I decided to make it fun and have a good time doing it. I even bought a copy of M&F....<br /><br />Same old stuff. I mean, all the people that are in the magazine now are different, but it's the same old stuff that I read 25 years ago. The 'champions' now are HUGE and grotesque. There are people like Jay Cutler and Ronnie Coleman who are weighing close to 300lbs at 5'11"".<br /><br />What the hell, man?<br /><br />I think what really gets me now is all the advertising. You are paying six bucks for a magazine that is 80% ads. The ads these days even 'disguise' themselves to look like training articles, but they're still ads.<br /><br />My suggestion is to look on e-bay and maybe buy some older versions of the magazine. Give yourself the opportunity to look at the 'golden days' of the sport. Yes, steroid use was happening even back then but it wasn't so obviously blatant as it is now.<br /><br />Working out should be fun. I believe that the more fun it is, the more productive you will be. I know I'll never be Mr. Olympia, but so what...I won a bigger prize...I won my own self-appreciation.<br /><br />Here's hoping you appreciate the gift that is the body.<br /><br />Peace and Blessings,<br />john 'the Light Coach'",[],B00005N7RO,B00005N7RO,AH4ZTOSFIBLS7JL4U77DQW73PWTQ,2007-12-22 15:53:25.000,73,False

3,off to a promising start,"Here's a magazine that speaks to the inner tinkerer. In spite of its title, it's not about things that are ready-made but about a willingness to make stuff. The spirit behind it is good and refreshing.<br />Unfortunately, the performance doesn't match the spirit. The projects are hokey and many of the ideas are embarrassingly banal. There's also not much in the way of instruction in basic skills.<br />So if you don't mind a low good idea/page ratio, by all means subscribe-maybe they'll grow into it.",[],B000XXDJ8E,B000XXDJ8E,AE7XXMSQGLWI2WA65ZYPSJPPJDEQ,2008-06-08 21:32:18.000,10,False
5,There's Nothing More Radical than Telling the Truth,"Consumer Reports is the first magazine dedicated to telling consumers the<br />truth about the things they buy. This seemingly obvious service has been<br />condemned as totalitarion, mocked for its materialism and subverted by<br />commercial interests who copy CR''s style but not its veracity.<br /><br />Yes, it's true that the evaluative criteria are often more narrow than an<br />expert in a field would prefer. It's also true that some of the reviews should<br />include a brief reflection on whether the product in question should be<br />purchased at all. But CR's 'naivete' has a value. When they question the validity<br />of a medical treatment, for instance, they have no cultural axe to grind any<br />more than they have a commercial one when they review a toaster.<br /><br />Hooray for CR and the radical idea of a magazine that simple tells the truth.<br /><br />--Lynn Hoffman, author of The New Short Course in Wine and the outrageous new<br />novel, bang BANG",[],B00005N7PH,B00005N7PH,AE7XXMSQGLWI2WA65ZYPSJPPJDEQ,2007-09-01 15:24:25.000,1,False
5,As close to the absolute truth as you can get in Boatland,"Sailboats may ride with the wind and float on the water, but they are absolutely<br />sold with hype and romance. If you consider that the sailing tradition itself is<br /> a combination of elitist romanticism and macho stoicism, it seems almost<br />natural that it's hard to get straight information about anything.<br /><br />Most Sailing magazines are advertising-driven. That means that they make their<br />money by catering to their advertisers, so 'product reviews' are really pretty much<br />puff pieces. Even the most experienced and forthright sailors have limited<br />experience with brands of boats and types of gear.<br /><br />Into the gap comes Practical Sailor. PS accepts no advertising. It does rigorous testing<br />and includes information on products that are never advertised. (Has any other boating<br />magazine reviewed the splendid Rhodes 22?). It is thoroughly indexed and non-subscribers<br />can order reprints of articles on topics of interest to them.<br /><br />Note that the reviews tend to be of very high-end items and that an annual<br />subscription is a pricey $84 for 20 issues. That's a lot of money in the world<br />of magazines, but not much money in the world of sailboats.<br /><br />Lynn Hoffman-author of The New Short Course in Wine and the outrageous new novel bang BANG.",[],B00006KTBI,B00006KTBI,AE7XXMSQGLWI2WA65ZYPSJPPJDEQ,2007-09-01 15:13:27.000,13,False
4,The Uses of Luxury,"The Robb Report should probably call itself 'The<br /><br />Magazine for People with Way Too Much Money'. It<br /><br />is a critical examination of the goods, services<br /><br />and experiences available to those for whom<br /><br />money is no object. There is  no advice on getting<br /><br />the most out of a tight budget, just advice on<br /><br />getting the most.<br /><br />So, if you don't happen to be in that bracket, what's<br /><br />the point? Why read about what you can't attain?<br /><br />If you can keep envy in check, there are three<br /><br />reasons to read the Robb Report regularly.<br /><br />1. it makes for very good fantasizing. Think of it<br /><br />as a harmless form of consumer-porn.<br /><br />2. the rich really do live well and there are ideas<br /><br />you can adapt from them to your own more modest<br /><br />circumstances.<br /><br />3. some of the writing is superb. Read Jack Smith on<br /><br />hiking through the Alps (Jan2007)for instance.<br /><br />If you can't afford the experiences descibed in the<br /><br />Robb Report, you can at least have the comfort of<br /><br />their acquaintance. Of course, you could, alternatively<br /><br />save the cover price, read it in the library and invest<br /><br />the money you saved in a no-load mutual fund. Allowing<br /><br />for growth and compounding and all, you'll probably be<br /><br />able to afford that yacht about nine thousand years<br /><br />from now.<br /><br />--Lynn Hoffman, author of THE NEW SHORT COURSE IN WINE and<br /><br />the forthcoming novel bang BANG from Kunati Books.ISBN<br /><br />9781601640005",[],B00005NIOP,B00005NIOP,AE7XXMSQGLWI2WA65ZYPSJPPJDEQ,2007-02-15 23:22:28.000,8,False
5,An Honest Voice,"There's an inescapeable feeling when reading most writing<br /><br />publications that you're about to be fleeced. There are ads<br /><br />that offer instant publication, or expensive editorial and<br /><br />design services. There is also a tone of phony upbeat optimism<br /><br />about success in what is admittedly one of the most competitive<br /><br />arenas in the world.<br /><br />So Poets & Writers is a relief and a blessing. It offers realistic,<br /><br />unfawning stories about the experience of real writers. It<br /><br />also has listings of real prize competitions (not the phony<br /><br />ones that are about collecting entry fees), winners of<br /><br />competitions and notices of grants and awards.<br /><br />Perhaps the best endorsement of all comes from my discarded<br /><br />copies. I bring them to the magazine rack at my gym. As I<br /><br />walk past the ranks of people doing their dutiful cardio,<br /><br />I almost always see one copy being read.<br /><br />Next to the magazine of the Author's Guild, there's no<br /><br />better periodical for the committed writer.<br /><br />--Lynn Hoffman, author of THE NEW SHORT COURSE IN WINE and<br /><br />the forthcoming novel bang BANG from Kunati Books.ISBN 9781601640005",[],B00006KT0K,B00006KT0K,AE7XXMSQGLWI2WA65ZYPSJPPJDEQ,2006-12-29 22:49:14.000,11,False

4,A wanna-be serious magazine for folks with ADHD,"Jeff Goldblum's character in ""The Big Chill"" said that he couldn't write an article longer than the average person could read during a, er, ""trip to the library"" (wink, wink, nudge, nudge, know what I mean?). The writers at Details seems to have the same marching orders. In these hectic times, maybe that's not so bad. The articles I have read are well researched and nicely bite-sized.  I actually finished the entire magazine between PM mail delivery and breakfast the next day. The topics they covered in my first issue ranged from fashion to health concerns. And, again, they cover the topics in very few, well-written pages. I do think the models look like under-fed children but at my age, that could be tunnel-vision (grey hair, I remember Filmore East, you get the picture?). My suggestion, take a look.

I must be way, way outside the mag's main demographics (I suspect it's 13-16 year old lonely males). Pictures: Lots of T&amp;A, girls in skimpy two size too small bikinis in splashing water and seductive poses kind of typify the majority of each issue. The text part (I really did try to read some of it) is mostly lame, puncutated by poorly written jokes. I can't believe that the subscription base exceeds one million....

5,Fine Writing and Aggressively Edited,"I was fortunate enough to receive a copy of GRIFFITH REVIEW no. 39 on ""Tasmania: The Tipping Point"" - a series of position papers, reminiscences, essays and other material on the island's past, present and future.  I found the collection inspiring, not only varied in terms of tone and stance, but finely written.  Editors Julianne Schultz and Natasha Cica have assembled a fine team of contributors, who contribute the kind of material that proves absolutely game-changing.  Until I encountered this volume, I knew next to nothing about Tasmania - except, perhaps, that it had produced two excellent cricketers, Ricky Ponting and David Boom.  After having read the volume, I understood a lot more about Australian history, its colonial past and postcolonial present and future; as well as the status of an island that is often marginalized in terms of its relationship to the mainland.

Many, if not most of the articles are several pages long and because the magazine comes once per week, I never feel like I can get caught up on current happenings in sports so I end up not reading it at all.

4,Looking at the world through gospel spectacles,"Third Way is a broadly evangelical, albeit fairly left-wing, publication, but I am confident its appeal will stretch to Christians of almost any stripe. Its mandate is to look at contemporary cultural and social issues from a Christian perspective. Third Way deliberately steers clear of inhouse issues (ie. purely &quot;church&quot; matters).<br />The typical issue features debate on social issues, biblical meditations and commentaries, political opinion, interviews and reviews among other interesting tidbits. Always food for thought in there somewhere.<br />The cover price is a little much for a relatively slim magazine, but for such good quality with, I would guess, a small audience, I guess we can't complain.",[],B00006KZIS,B00006KZIS,AHHO2RRHWPYE5GW2UBT2KRQULPPA,2004-02-17 17:52:44.000,2,False
2,Mouthpiece for the modern charismatic renewal,"Charisma is a good source for news of the latest goings-on in the world of the contemporary charismatic movement. If you want to know what the televangelists are up to, where the latest revival is breaking out, or in what exciting and exotic ways the Holy Spirit is being manifested in this place or that, Charisma magazine is the place to look. Its usefulness pretty much ends there.<br />The glossy advertisements for hotshot healing evangelists, success gurus and big-name ministries are simply nauseating to most outside the world of card-carrying Pentecostals and charismatics, and next to them, anything useful or sensible the editors might occasionally have to say looks rather hollow and disingenuous. Most of the content will seem alien and bizarre to all but health and wealth, devil-bashing conservative fundamentalists. And &quot;fundamentalist&quot; -- despite the sometimes relatively moderate stance of the editors -- does describe very accurately Charisma's readership, I think, as a glance at the letters page will usually show.<br />One caveat: It is a few months since I have been a regular reader, so there is a slim chance things may have changed.",[],B00005RIGT,B00005RIGT,AHHO2RRHWPYE5GW2UBT2KRQULPPA,2004-02-17 16:47:02.000,15,False

I as I understand there are three different cover versions; one that has Holly Madison on the front cover, another with Bridget Marquardt on the front cover, still a third version with Kendra Wilkinson on the front cover. Starting in the February 2009 magazine there are some changes in the magazine. The Playboy Forum is now at the end of the magazine and no longer in the beginning, the Grapevine has gone from black and white to color, and the contents pages have change. Even the Playmate News section has change as well.<br /><br />This month pictorials are: Marta Gut-Poland's Playboy Playmate of the Month for July 2007, The Year In Sex (50% nudity there), Playmate Jessica Burciaga (her centerfold is the best part), and The Girls Next Door Holly Madison, Bridget Marquardt, and Kendra Wilkinson. The Girls Next Door pictorial was the best of the four. This month interview is with Hugh Laurie and I must admit I have only seen two full episodes of House and yet I still read the interview. 20 Questions is with Josh Holloway of Lost and did not read by the way. Other articles are the lawlessness of Guinea-Bissau, The Whistle Blowers - the life of a football referee, and Peep Culture. Only time will tell if I like this new arrangement.

5,Fantasy and Science Fiction as Literature,"I've subscribed to this magazine since I was 13 years old, back in 1972.  I've seen fashions come and fashions go; writers like Barry Malzberg that got published in Galaxy and Amazing but not in F&SF, while those latter two scoffed at the 'stuffy' little Fantasy and Science Fiction geekheads.  F&SF had Ed Ferman editing every issue, and he knew what constituted good literature.  Just good literature with a speculative or fantastic element.  So: Philip K. Dick wrote for F&SF; Stephen King writes for S&SF; Ray Bradbury would only sell to F&SF for a time.  If those three chose this magazine for its consistent quality, well, you might want to find out why.<br /><br />Every issue has a story that you will remember long after you've put it on the shelf.

5,I look forward to every issue.,"Some say that this magazine is the little sister to Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine, but I find this a false comparison.  The two publications don't publish the same kind of story.  EQ publishes a few excellent stories in each issue, and the rest are fill.  Some of the good stories could fit in an issue of The New Yorker or The Atlantic: they seem so generic.  Alfred Hitchcock Mystery Magazine, on the other hand, publishes fewer stories, but all of them seem to be of a higher average quality than I find in EQ.  There are some good noirs, occasionally humor, and all this printed in a far more easily seen typeface.  There are two or three fewer lines per page than in EQ, and the font is slightly different.  It's just easier to read on the cheap paper these magazines use.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I have no option of having the magazine sent to me in a kraft envelope.

Imagine The Economist at thrice its size, with longer articles, and written in German: that is Der Spiegel.<br />When I was still learning the language, I found Spiegel rather difficult to understand.

5,Well Titled,"This is a great magazine, and well-titled. The gardening it features is indeed more ""fine"" than that found in other magazines, with the possible exception of Horticulture (a tie, I'd say), as well as several British mags such as Gardens Illustrated (no contest, I'd say, although its wonderful prose and extra-thick glossy pages come at more than twice the price, and of course the British climate is not similar to much of the US except for coastal Oregon and Washington).<br /><br />Let me illustrate from my bookshelf: the more middle-brow magazine (not that there's anything wrong with that!) Country Living Gardener has run a cover story titled ""bigger, better dahlias; grow a rainbow of dahlias, America's favorite late-season flower"" while Fine Gardening has run ""ANTIQUE BEAUTIES: Heirloom dahlias, gladioli and cannas offer flower colors and forms unmatched by more recent introductions,"" and the Gardens Illustrated version is ""Fergus Garret, head gardener at Great Dixter, on the exhuberant appeal of the fashionable dahlia.""<br /><br />OK, what's ""fine"" to one is snobbery to the next guy. If you want English-style gardens with an emphasis on perennials, or you have already read books by the likes of Christopher Lloyd (owner of Great Dixter), then you are more on the ""fine"" end of the continuum, (or ""beyond fine"" to British); if you want to put a wheelbarrow full of daisies in your front yard, or to brighten up your porch with hanging baskets of scarlet Pelargoniums, then look to magazines with ""Country"" or even ""Redneck"" in the title.<br /><br />On a more serious note, one problem with all types of specialty magazines is that you will generally outgrow them. This is not likely to affect your appreciation of ""Fine Gardening"" all that much for some time, if ever, but of course those parts of any magazine which are essentially ""timeless"" will repeat over time, and will be redundant with your book collection, if you have one; while those parts which are news (such as latest cultivars, new diseases, truly new techniques) are naturally best learned from a magazine. Fine Gardening has plenty of the latter, as well as beautiful ""garden porn"" which will appeal to experts as well as novices.",[],B000063XJI,B000063XJI,AHFSWVRFTJGNDGJ6CAHPRL3XUW4Q,2005-12-11 03:33:24.000,7,False
4,"Lucid articles, broad selection of articles on safety topics","Aviation Safety, another fine monthly from Belvoir publications, focuses on a variety of safe piloting topics.  Where NTSB Reporter dwells on meticulous post mortems, A.S. may cover an accident then spend a lot of text suggesting how you could develop the appropriate technique beyond the theory you learned from your CFI.<br />For example, most aviators are familiar with the &quot;demonstrated crosswind component&quot; in the pilot operating handbook.  It's not a limiting factor, just what the plane was tested against.  Aviation Safety might have an article explaining how to develop your piloting technique so if you were faced with a stronger crosswind, you could operate in a less forgiving zone of performance.  (After practice, I employed this during a 30 knot crosswind at Billings, MT)<br />Like IFR, it's refreshing (pun intended) because they'll call a stupid procedure a stupid procedure.

4,Frightening and thorough analysis of accidents.,"By nature, this is a very depressing publication: Peter Garrison reviews aviation accidents that usually resulted in someone dying.  One subscribes NTSB reporter in hopes of avoiding similar mistakes.<br />A shorter version of Peter Garrison's NTSB columns appear in Flying Magazine.  NTSB Reporter's trademark is a *much* more thorough analysis of a specific accident.<br />It's immensely thoughtful, but I would not leave copies lying around on the coffee table for non-pilots or spouses.  to see them.",[],B00006KQRS,B00006KQRS,AEEKJBL7ZP4RSBPB6KFWTAP26CMA,2002-11-24 07:32:22.000,7,False

3,"Useful, but has limitations","Like the other Belvior aviation publications, this is one you should certainly consider subscribing to.  Its heart is in the right place as it tries well, but because aviators aren't as unbiased and ubiquitous as those who buy small kitchen appliances, the results are worth only a few grains of salt.<br />[For an opinion on their airplane reviews, please see my review of their book publication.]<br />In an older article, they took on the challenge of a vendor who claimed their oil additive would make an engine last longer.  (This is the aviator's equivalent of: &quot;Lose 30lbs in one month - ask me how!&quot;)  The article was hilarious in its razor-sharp dicing of the claims and vendor's avoidance of an unbiased test.<br />This is where AC really shines.<br />On the other hand, a lot of what they try to do is hurt by the sample size available.  For example, in a recent issue they considered the merits of overhauling an engine at a big name shop (Mattituck, Victor, Penn Yan, etc) versus versus local shop.  With only a few dozen responses -- overhauling an engine is something few pilots are familiar with -- the confidence interval on the big names was extremely wide.<br />In the article, it was noted that one particular big name shop that fared poorly in previous surveys did much better this time around, it was suggested, because it made some of its happier customers aware of the survey.  (In other words, ballot stuffing.)<br />The results would be even wilder for your local shop, thus their advice that you ask around locally if that's the option you want to pursue.<br />At its best, Aviation Consumer is a tool for considering planes and equipment and learning some of the general nuances.  Once you've narrowed your choice down, get the full monty from a local user's group or someone who'se owned it for a while.",[],B00006K52J,B00006K52J,AEEKJBL7ZP4RSBPB6KFWTAP26CMA,2002-11-23 17:36:00.000,7,False
4,"Funny, useful tips for the instrument-rated pilot","IFR is one of several Belvoir aviation publications (Aviation Consumer, IFR pilot, light plane maintenance...) and retains their fine blend of humor and practicality.  The assumption is the reader either has an IFR rating or is well-on her way.<br />Each issue has a general theme, often related to the season.  For example, a recent issue explored zero-zero (no visibility, ceiling) takeoffs, as would be observed if a field were socked in with a 50' thick layer at ground-level.  It's perfectly legal for part 91 (general aviation) flying, but often neglected as an option.  Included in the article are legal considerations and ways of mitigating risk.<br />The monthly columns are also fun. Two of my favorites:<br />IFR quiz -- related to the primary topic of that issue, the quiz involves a combination of interpreting ATC regulations, navigation, chart symbiology and the realities of IFR flying.  These are invaluable because you learn about the *intent* behind the presentation.<br />On the Air -- the aviator's equivalent of bloopers.",[],B00006KHRJ,B00006KHRJ,AEEKJBL7ZP4RSBPB6KFWTAP26CMA,2002-11-23 16:58:19.000,5,False

1,Very disappointing platform incompatibility,"After much research, I decided to buy an Android tablet to be my multimedia device/computing bridge for my move to Singapore. I had learned that I'd be able to download a Kindle app so that I could get the advantages I needed from the tablet I chose while still purchasing and enjoying Kindle books and Amazon videos. With that in mind, I purchased a renewal of the TVGuide through Amazon so that I could enjoy the digital version on my tablet while overseas. Then, I learned that despite having downloaded the Amazon Kindle app, I would not be able to access my digital version of TVGuide since it was only compatible with an actual Kindle.<br /><br />Amazon professes to be the company that ""changes your normal"" and then ""fades into the background of everyday living."" I feel like this incompatibility solely exists to motivate users to buy a Kindle, when in reality, Amazon would be making more than their $199 just on my purchases of movies, TV shows and magazines alone. Amazon, please improve these compatibility issues. It should be enough that I'm purchasing my multimedia through you instead of the other providers out there.

That means if there's any delays, like you're busy, took some time to ride your bike in the evening etc, the next weekly will arrive before you're finished, and you'll have a backlog of editions before you know it. it makes it feel like reading it is forced, not just at a leisurely pace.

They may not have been decimated like newspapers have been, but many great titles are now lost to history. I love reading print materials, and in looking to add a new magazine to my library, being an aviation enthusiast I subscribed to Flight Journal to give it a try. The first two issues so far have really impressed me with the quality of the writing, the depth of the articles and the breadth of the subjects this ""Journal"" covers. In this day and age of minimal attention spans, knee-jerk opinionated writing styles and lack of any research or thoroughness in what passes for current magazine production, Flight Journal is a breath of fresh air.

5,One of my favorite reads,"I have enjoyed Reader's Digest all of my life. I still love reading each issue. It's not the Reader's Digest of times gone by, but considering what has happened to so many publications I feel they are still doing a wonderful job of providing interesting articles and stories that can appeal to a vast audience. I look forward to each issue and recommend it to anyone who would like to broaden their knowledge of the world.",[],B004GVZUUY,B004GVZUUY,AFOWHOG3GLMBU5IF45DTKDL3UVZQ,2020-01-08 23:27:58.710,0,True
5,A good read after you've gotten a few issues under your belt,"I was looking for a magazine to broaden my reading habits. I'm retired now, but during my working years I subscribed to a couple of motorcycle magazines and a gun magazine. Yes, I used to ride and shoot, but due to work that was all I had time for. Once I retired I looked around and added a magazine on flying, wood working and finally added Car and Driver. Why Car and Driver? Well, I managed to read a few articles over time when I would come across an issue (usually at my barber's shop), and I found them fairly well done, so I subscribed. It took me a few issues to get into the different writers, how the mag was put together each month and I eventually began to get a feel for what the publisher was doing. Then, unexpectedly, the editor of the magazine announced he was leaving and someone else would be taking over. No big thing I guess, since I hadn't been reading it very long. How well the new editor is doing is something I haven't got a feel for yet, but there is one thing I do have a feeling for. This magazine is for the well-heeled (or those dreaming to be). If you read this magazine to find out about what your next car should be, well apparently you are looking for a Mercedes or BMW, Audi, Aston Martin, McLaren or some other vehicle that will set you back a good amount of money. Sure they cover the occasional Toyota, Mazda or some other more proletarian form of transportation. I personally own a KIA Soul, but in the year I have subscribed I have seen the magazine ""mention"" the Soul twice, but no tests or comparisons. In fact they made some sort of comment like they didn't know what to compare it to. They will mention in passing things such as, ""The Corolla is acceptable, but soooo boring."" Well, that I'm sure is very true coming from the apparently lofty worlds these writers inhabit. But it does become somewhat boring reading about writers lamenting despite how well this expensive sports car handles the manufacturer couldn't upgrade the plastic used in the interior. Personally, I couldn't afford the plastic the manufacturer did use, nor would I turn it down if I could afford the car. It's wonderful to read about how the well-to-do do do, but it would be nice to read more often about how some of the lesser-to-dos find their credit union-financed family cars and vans. I believe Car and Driver does a fine job in covering those vehicles that they seem to prefer, but I would like to find a magazine that does what Car and Driver does for vehicles that more people could actually afford to buy. Say starting under $30,000. Yeah, I can hear the writers at C and D laughing their heads off at that one now. How many vehicles for sale are there left on the market now that start under $30,000? Regardless, I intend to keep reading Car and Driver, at least until someone comes along with a magazine that plays more to the cheap seats, where I must sit most of the time.",[],B005NCTK56,B005NCTK56,AFOWHOG3GLMBU5IF45DTKDL3UVZQ,2020-01-08 23:16:44.582,10,True
5,Thought I would give it a try.,"I grew up reading Popular Science, Cycle, etc., but never really looked into Popular Mechanics. I recently retired and found my reading materials library was running short quite frequently, so when an offer came up to subscribe to Pop Mechanics I decided to give it a try. It has turned out to be one of the magazines I look forward to getting each month because it offers variety presented in a reasonable amount of detail. So many things that used to be done in depth have either been ""dumbed-down"" or have ceased publication. Pop Mechanics seems to hit a nice balance of enough information in their articles to answer your questions or present a fair assessment of a situation, without going overboard. I admit that some of the articles leave me wishing the publisher had done more on certain stories, but at the same time I have more than enough to go on and do my own research. And kudos to them for continuing to publish in a hard-copy format when so many (too many) others have pulled their heads back into their digital shells. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a  Luddite; I simply like having a physical medium to read at times. It's nice not to have to make sure my tablet is charged and connected to my network, plus the physical magazine is much lighter to hold on to when I'm reading in bed, compared to holding onto my tablet or trying to balance my laptop on my bed covers. Pop Mechanics does a fine job of getting the mechanical principles of how things work across, and it would help a lot of younger people if they spent a little time investigating this part of their lives, because one day they are going to need to know how some physical principle or property applies or works and all they're going to know how to do is download apps onto their phones. Popular Mechanics relates to the real world, the one we all live in.",[],B001THPA26,B001THPA26,AFOWHOG3GLMBU5IF45DTKDL3UVZQ,2018-12-14 22:51:22.828,10,True
